## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a Java library we often find vulernabilities are reported by downstream (and thus user facing) projects.

* We ask that vulernabilities be reported via our bi-weekly video chat meeting (see developer list for invite).
* GeoTools is an Open Source Geospatial Foundation project, the [geotools project officer](https://www.osgeo.org/about/board/) can be emailed directly if you are unable to attend meeting above.
* New: We have enabled GitHub Security Advisories allowing secure reporting of vulnerabilities directly to the projec team

To allow downstream projects an oppertunity to upgrade the library issue tracker uses placeholder issues (with no description or details). Details are added when fix is available in supported and maintenance branches above.
