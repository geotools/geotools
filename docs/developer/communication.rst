The GeoTools Project practices “open development” with project communication taking place using a range of public forums.

geotools-gt2-users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The users list is for questions regarding the installation or use of the GeoTools library. Users of GeoTools are usually Java developers building applications with spatial capabilities.

* https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-gt2-users
* https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=geotools-gt2-users

Although GeoTools is primarily a Java library, it is also used to host some small tools or server-side code (for example a refactoring script, or a format conversion utility). If these have not yet found a project of their own, then questions about how to use these tools may be directed to this list.

geotools-devel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Much of the development discussion happens on the geotools-devel mailing list.
If your query is more general, e.g. you need help with how to use GeoTools,
please use the geotools-gt2-users mailing list.

 * https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-devel
 * https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=geotools-devel

The developer list is used by the development team of GeoTools solely to discuss development issues. The list is exclusively for:

1. current members of the GeoTools2 development team.
2. those who are interested in joining the GeoTools development effort.
3. those who wish to follow the discussions surrounding GeoTools development.

Please do not send general questions regarding the use of GeoTools to this list, but to geotools-gt2-users above.

Commit Tracker
--------------

To follow new commits and pull requests to the GeoTools repository, GitHub provides a tracking feature called
`Watching Repositories <https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories>`_. Following the instructions provided
by GitHub you are able to customise the feed of information you are able to receive. Note that GeoTools doesn't utilise
the issue feature of GitHub; see the *Issue tracker* section below.

Other pages that may be helpful in following GeoTools are the `pulse <https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pulse>`_ and
the `commits <https://github.com/geotools/geotools/commits>`_. Both are pages that provide summary information about the
current activity of the project.

Issue Tracker
---------------

GeoTools tracks tasks, issues and bugs with its JIRA tracker, provided by Atlassian cloud hosting for OSGeo Foundation.

This is where all bugs should be reported, in addition to requested features and improvements.

* https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/projects/GEOT

Filling out all fields is specially important for bug reports:

* Including component(s)
* Affected versions of GeoTools
* A description of what caused the problem (example code that reproduces the problem) along with any stack traces
* Java Version and the type of operating system you are using
* Attach any supporting information such as log files, or screen snapshots
* To reporting failed tests during the maven build, check the test reports in
  ``<module>/target/surefire-reports`` for further details.

The User Guide has an example of `creating a new issue <https://docs.geotools.org/latest/userguide/welcome/support.html#issue-tracker>`_.

Developer Chat
--------------

GeoTools has a developer chat on Gitter, which has migrated to Matrix Infrastructure.

* `https://matrix.to/#/#geotools_geotools:gitter.im <https://matrix.to/#/#geotools_geotools:gitter.im>`__

This is used on occasion when email is too slow - this is also a suitable venue for development questions.

Video Chat
----------

GeoTools Project Management Committee attends a 1 hour bi-weekly video chat. Meetings are at
`17:30 UTC <https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=18&min=30&sec=0&msg=GeoTools%20/%20GeoServer%20Meeting&ah=1&sort=1&p1=215>`__.
If you wish to attend keep an eye on the developer list for an invite / reminder.

* https://meet.osgeo.org/GeoServerMeeting

Occasionally breakout meetings will be announced on the geotools-devel mailing list around
specific topics of interest.

Anyone is free to start a meeting; we ask that an email be sent out and a time coordinated on the email list allowing interested parties to attend.

Wiki
----

Use GitHub wiki to work on design ideas and change proposals:

* https://github.com/geotools/geotools/wiki

Developers can edit the wiki directly using the Edit button provided.

If you do not have commit access and would like to submit a change proposal please email geotools-devel and a committer can post on your behalf.
