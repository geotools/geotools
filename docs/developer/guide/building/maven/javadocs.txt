Generating Javadocs
-------------------

Javadoc can be generated using the standard mvn javadoc:javadoc command.

* It can be generated for an individual module::
     
     cd modules/main/cql
     mvn javadoc:javadoc

* “Aggregated” javadocs for the entire GeoTools project can be generated from root using::
     
     mvn javadoc:javadoc

Dependencies in aggregated javadoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of October 2006, aggregated javadoc using maven-javadoc-plugin version 2.0 fails to resolve all external dependencies like JTS or GeoAPI. It may be related to MJAVADOC-66, but the later said that the bug is already fixed. Waiting for the next maven-javadoc-plugin release in the hope that it will be fixed there.

JAR files for distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use Java 6 for this; because we use some fancy tags (mentioned below) you will need to use Java 6 here
JAR files are created by invoking:
1. mvn javadoc:javadoc
2. mvn javadoc:jar
3. The javadocs are created in the target directory for each module.

Custom javadoc tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Geotools code contains a few custom javadoc tags, including:
* Tag: @Source
  
  The file URL, usually provided by SVN itself::
     
     @Source $URL$

* Tag: @Tutorial
  
  Link a tutorial page on this server.	 

These custom tags are processed by taglets provided in the GeoTools maven/javadoc module. These taglets are automatically used by the javadoc tools when using the javadoc:javadoc goal.

Modifying the javadoc configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **trunk/pom.xml** file contains the javadoc:javadoc goal configuration. This configuration includes custom taglets, hyperlink to external libraries like JTS, list of package to exclude, etc.

Excluded packages are:
* com.*
* org.geotools.maven.*
* org.geotools.resources.*.

When Maven fails to generate the javadoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building Javadoc produces many "warnings" and "errors". Only errors cause the build to stop.
GeoTools javadocs produce a lot of warnings making it difficult to spot the error that caused javadoc to fail.

1. Thankfully the following Unix command is very helpful::
      
      mvn javadoc:javadoc | grep "error"
   
2. The above gives a much smaller output, typically only about 5 lines. So we can spot immediately the cause of javadoc failure, for example something like::
      
      modules/library/referencing/src/main/java/org/geotools/referencing/factory/epsg/package.html:
      error - Close body tag missing from HTML file
   
3. In the above example  adding the missing </BODY> tag as suggested by the error message would the javadoc generation.
