Managing Pull Requests
======================

Pull Requests (PR) via GitHub are the preferred method of contributing code changes to GeoTools. A PR notifies the
GeoTools community of some code changes focused around an issue. It allows the relevant Module Maintainer (MM) and
others to review the set of changes, discuss issues and suggest fixes before the PR can be merged into the official
repository.

The merging of PRs is ultimately a responsibility of MMs, and to a lesser extent members of the PMC. Do not merge PRs if
you are not responsible for the code. For other, act responsibility and collaboratively.

Merging a Pull Request
----------------------

If the PR's contributor has followed the guidelines for GeoTools and has written good quality code, then it is likely
that the PR will be merged quickly by the MM. There maybe reasons why a PR may not be merged quickly; requiring a unit
test is just one example. To progress the PR, a conversation with the contributor concerning the issues around the PR is
required. Any discussion regarding the PR should be confined to its thread established by GitHub. There may be issues
raised that are larger than the PR; take these to mailing lists as appropriate. - **Discuss Issues**

Delays in Merging a Pull Request
--------------------------------

If the issues concerning the PR have been addressed it can be merged. If the contributor or other individuals are not
willing to address the issues, then a decision needs to be made regarding the PR's future. The MM is in the best
position to make this assessment. If there are legitimate reasons for the PR to remain open they need to be recorded. An
example would be a pending feature freeze and a delay will allow GeoTools and upstream projects to deal with
ramifications of the change post the freeze. If no firm decision can be made then leave the PR open; time may be our
friend. - **Record Decisions**

Avoiding Merge Problems
-----------------------

While the issues with the PR may be resolved given the time; it exposes another problem that becomes more likely with
time: merge conflicts. The code in the repository changes overtime which may conflict with the new code in the PR.
While possible; trying to reconcile differences between files is likely to introduce errors. GitHub assists with merging
PR by flagging merge conflicts and disabling the merge option. It is always possible to use Git via the command line to
merge the PR. Avoiding merge conflicts is always preferable. - **Avoid Merge Conflicts**

Other Issues
------------

Even if there are no merge conflicts; there are some questions raised for a long standing PR. What is the status for an
old PR on the master branch when a new stable branch is created? Is it left as it is, moved to the new stable branch,
duplicated to the new stable branch or closed unmerged? Despite being no problems with the merging of a PR; the issue
maybe resolved by the GeoTools community in other ways. Merging the PR would only add cruft to the code base. - **Avoid
Unnecessary Work**

The Solution
------------

The simple solution to a long standing PR, and avoiding merge conflicts; is to simply close the PR - unmerged. If issues
have been discussed and decisions recorded; and there is no impending resolution to the PR then it is better to close
the PR. Record the reason why the PR is being closed unmerged. It is possible to reopen an unmerged PR at a latter date,
resolve merge conflicts and associated issues, and then merge the PR. - **Close the PR**

While this is a simple solution there are number of checks before closing an unmerged PR that will help everyone involved:

  * Check with the MM, if your not it, or a member of the PMC; that it is fine to close the PR. The MM has the
    responsibility for maintaining the code and needs to kept informed of changes. The MM has every right to say no.
  * Ensure that an associated JIRA issue has been created, create one if not so. Document the PR in the JIRA issue and
    visa versa.
  * Be clear with the reason for closing the PR. We don't want to create animosity with contributors. Provide links to
    documentation and guidelines where appropriate. Be helpful.
  * Document the reason in the associated JIRA issue. Leave the JIRA issue open with a resolution of incomplete or
    unresolved.
  * Document the reason in the PR and close it. It is possible to reopen a PR, resolve issues and merge it latter.

Final Message
-------------

Long standing PRs need to be handled appropriately so that everyone benefits. Contributors may learn how to better
collaborate with GeoTools. MMs may have to incorporate new features of a problem. Ultimaltely, PRs are tied to the code
base; and, if not handled with care they may lead to problems creating unnecessary work. While the risk of harm is
small, the reputation of GeoTools relies upon the integrity of it's code base and the good work of contributors.

The closing of long standing PRs provides a barrier; protecting the code base. Also, GitHub lacks the comprehensive
search facilities of the like of JIRA. The creation of an associated JIRA issue allows the search facilities of JIRA to
be leveraged when looking for information concerning an issue. JIRA has a long history of changes made to the GeoTools
project, an invaluable resource. Give it as much information possible for it to be used to the best of its abilities.

In the history of a long standing PR, there are ample opportunities to talk about issues, document decisions and improve
the PR. These are important facets of working collaboratively in GeoTools. Try to be helpful and keep others informed
when handling a long standing PR.
