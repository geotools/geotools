Project Management Committee
============================

.. sidebar:: Recommended
   
   We encourage downstream projects to seek representation on the PMC in order to communicate
   and protect the interests of your development community with respect to strategic direction.

Members of the community who have an interest in the greater direction of the project may have their
status promoted to that of a Project Management Committee Member. This committee is the official
managing body of the Project and is responsible for setting overall project direction.

The PMC makes all decisions that cannot be resolved by module maintainers. The PMC strives to make
as few technical decisions as possible, preferring to leave technical decisions to module
maintainers and a general consensus process.

PMC
---

The GeoTools PMC is the formal "Project Steering Committee" for GeoTools:

* The Project Management Committee runs the GeoTools project on behalf of the Open Source
  Geospatial Foundation.

* The PMC is responsible for providing a "GeoTools Officer" to the OSGeo Foundation to act as a
  point of contact.
  
  * Jody Garnett ( `jgarnett <https://github.com/jodygarnett>`_ )

* Other Foundation committees may make request of the project in order to facilitate different
  initiatives such as promotion, fundraising, education and so forth. The only reliable request
  has been for a contribution to an annual report.

Current PMC members:

* Andrea Aime
* Ian Turton
* Jody Garnett
* Nuno Oliveira
* Simone Giannecchini
* Torben Barsballe

Nominations
^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to become a Member, someone on the PMC must nominate the Committer. The individual may
then be approved with a 75% majority of the PMC.

Stepping Down
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are unable to maintain your responsibilities as a PMC member, please feel free to step down
at any time. Thank you so much for your contributions.

If we cannot find you (especially when voting on proposals) it becomes very difficult to keep the
project functioning. After two months time we will send out a search party and nominate your
replacement.

Honoured Founder
