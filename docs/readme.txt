To build the docs for the first time....

.. this is covered in the developers guide setup instructions in greater details.

Windows Sphinx Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Python:

1. Python version 2.7 has been verified to work: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
2. You will need to add it to your path.::
     
     set 'PYTHON=C:\Python27\'
     set 'PATH=%PATH%;%PYTHON%'

3. You will need Setup Tools for Python 2.7
   
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads
   
4. Install and add Setup Tools to your path::
        
        run 'set SETUPTOOLS=C:\Python27\Scripts'
        run 'set PATH=%PATH%;%SETUPTOOLS%'

5. Install Sphinx::
   
        easy_install sphinx
   
   Optionally you could install a specific version of sphinx (although we try and use the latest)::
    
        easy_install sphinx==1.0.7

rst2pdf Optional Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can optionally install rst2pdf to build pdf documentation:

1. Install Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition (this provides windows with a C compiler). It is a free download on the Microsoft site.
   You need to be sure to use the 2008 edition so that easy_install will compile something that can actually be linked to the Python executable.

2. Use easy install to produce rst2pdf::
      
      easy_install rst2pdf
      
3. This depends on the Python Image Library (which it can probably build now that you have a compiler).
4. If you cannot manage to build you can download a precompiled Python Image Library (PIL) from here:
   
   * http://effbot.org/downloads/#pil (download the one for python 2.7)

Mac Sphinx Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the distribution manager of your choice (example bru, macports, etc...). The following example
is for macports.

1. On OSX Use macports to install Python 2.7::
     
     sudo port install python27
     sudo port install python_select
     sudo python_select python27
     
2. You can use macports to install Python Image Library::
     
     sudo port install py27-pil
     
3. You can now use python easy_install to install sphinx::
     
     sudo easy_install sphinx
   
   Optionally you could ask for a specific version (we try and use the latest)::
     
      sudo easy_install sphinx==1.0.7
 
4. To build the PDF targets you will also need rst2pdf.::
     
     sudo easy_install rst2pdf

5. If you uses easy_install to grab the python image library it easy to get compile errors.
      

Linux Sphinx Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use apt-get and easy install.

1. Python is usually available by default, if not::
     
      apt-get install Python
  
   You may need to use sudo (if for example you are on ubuntu)
      
2. Use easy_install to graph sphinx (using sudo if required)::
     
     easy_install sphinx
  
  Optionally you can install a specific version::
  
     easy_install sphinx==1.0.7
