Download and Install Maven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download Maven. Last tested with Maven 3.3.9.
2. Unzip the Maven download to your computer:
   
   Example: ``C:\java\apache-maven-3.3.9``.
   
   If you do not have an unzip program may we recommend: http://www.7-zip.org/

3. You need to have the following environmental variables set for Maven to work (note your paths may differ based on Java or Maven revision numbers):
   
   * ``JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.8.0_91\``
    
     Location of your JDK installation
   
   * ``M2_HOME = C:\java\apache-maven-3.0.5``
     
     Location of your Maven installation
   
   * ``PATH = %PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%M2_HOME%\bin``
     
     Include Java and Maven bin directory in your PATH

4. Open up a ``cmd`` window and type the following::
     
     > mvn -version

Maven and Apt-Get
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current versions of Ubuntu provide Maven 3; however if you're using an older version or you'd like to use the very latest, please
install the latest version manually by following the `official installation instructions <https://maven.apache.org/install.html>`_.

Maven and Home Brew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On macOS the homebrew package manager provides a "formula" to install Maven::

  brew install maven
