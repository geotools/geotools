Remote Repositories
-------------------

There are repositories of jars required by GeoTools stored online. These repositories are listed
in the root ``pom.xml`` file.

You can browse them online at:

  * https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ - maven central
  * https://repo.osgeo.org/repository/release/ - OSGeo project releases (including GeoTools)
  * https://repo.osgeo.org/repository/snapshot/ - OSGeo repository for daily snapshots (including GeoTools)

The repositories above act as a cache, gathering up artifacts from a range of projects into a single searchable location for the maven build system.

Reducing Internet Downloads

There are several tools to allow your development team to share a local mirror.
