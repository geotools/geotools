KML Parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^

KML is handled in a little bit of an unusual fashion as it defines
a data structure of nested features, and includes Style information.

Here is a fragment from the
:download:`states.kml file </../../modules/extension/xsd/xsd-kml/src/main/resources/org/geotools/kml/states.kml>`
we use in our test cases::

The Parser can use the KMLConfiguration to read out the contents of a KML file
as a single Feature.

Accessing the placemarks of that Feature returns a Collection<Feature>::

        Parser parser = new Parser(new KMLConfiguration());
        SimpleFeature f = (SimpleFeature) parser.parse( inputStream );
        Collection placemarks = (Collection) f.getAttribute("Feature");

The Streaming Parser is also available::

        StreamingParser parser = new StreamingParser( inputStream, KML.Placemark);
        SimpleFeature f = null;

        while ((f = (SimpleFeature) parser.parse()) != null) {
            FeatureTypeStyle style = (FeatureTypeStyle) f.getAttribute("Style");
            
            Symbolizer[] syms = style.getRules()[0].getSymbolizers();
            assertEquals(3, syms.length);
        }

KML Encoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KMLConfiguration provides the Encoder with the ability to generate KML output::

        Encoder encoder = new Encoder(new KMLConfiguration());
        encoder.setIndenting(true);

        encoder.encode(featureCollection, KML.kml, outputstream );

It can also work on a single Feature.
