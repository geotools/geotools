GeoTools
========

GeoTools is an open source (LGPL) Java code library which provides standards compliant methods for
the manipulation of geospatial data, for example to implement Geographic Information Systems.
The GeoTools library data structures are based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) specifications.

GeoTools is used by a number of projects including web services, command line tools and desktop
applications.

Core Features
-------------

* Definition of interfaces for key spatial concepts and data structures
  
  * Integrated Geometry support provided by Java Topology Suite (JTS)
  * Attribute and spatial filters using OGC Filter Encoding specification
  
* A clean data access API supporting feature access, transaction support and locking between threads
  
  * Access GIS data in many file formats and spatial databases
  * Coordinate reference system and transformation support
  * Work with an extensive range of map projections
  * filter and analyze data in terms of spatial and non-spatial attributes

* A stateless, low memory renderer, particularly useful in server-side environments.
  
  * compose and display maps with complex styling
  * vendor extensions for fine control of text labels and color blending

* Powerful *schema assisted* parsing technology using XML Schema to bind to GML content
  
  The parsing / encoding technology is provided with bindings for many OGC standards
  including GML, Filter, KML, SLD, and SE.
  
* GeoTools Plugins: open plug-in system allowing you to teach the library additional formats
  
  * Plug-ins for the ImageIO-EXT project allowing GeoTools to read additional raster formats from GDAL
 
* GeoTools Extensions

  Provide additional capabilities built using the spatial facilities of the core library.

  Extensions provide graph and networking support (for finding the shortest path), validation,
  a web map server client, bindings for XML parsing and encoding and color brewer!

* GeoTools Unsupported
  
  GeoTools also operates as part of a wider community with a staging area used to foster new
  talent and promote experimentation.
  
  Some highlights are swing support (used in our tutorials!), swt, local and web process support,
  additional symbology, additional data formats, generation of grids and a couple of implementations
  of ISO Geometry.
