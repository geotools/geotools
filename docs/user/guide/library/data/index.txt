Additional DataStore plugins are available from :doc:`gt-jdbc <../jdbc/index>` for database access.

The Data module is all about hoisting data (usually in the form of features) off of external services, disk files etc... into your application. This is where you can finally start putting the toolkit to work.

The gt-data module is the foundation for implementing additional :doc:`gt-api <../api/index>` DataStore formats:

* Abstract classes for :doc:`gt-api <../api/index>` DataStore implementors to start from such as **ContentDataStore** and **DirectoryDataStore**

The gt-data module requires plug ins for different formats to be supplied. The module does not define any additional interfaces.
