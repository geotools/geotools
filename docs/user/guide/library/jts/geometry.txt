Geometry
--------

To create a Geometry object we make use of the GeometryFactory provided by JTS. GeometryFactory has a bunch of create methods that take Coordinate instances (and arrays) and wrap them up in the appropriate instance of Geometry.

.. image:: /images/geometry.PNG

You can create your own GeometryFactory with a specific PrecisionModel and CoordinateSequenceFactory. These "advanced" configuration options are interest if you need to take charge of how your coordinates are stored (perhaps as floats rather than doubles?)

The GeometryFactory created by default works just fine.

Creating a Point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This time we are using a JTS GeometryFactory, although you can create one yourself (if you want to fiddle with Precision}} there is a global one available using the FactoryFinder.:

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/geometry/GeometryExamples.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // createPoint start
   :end-before: // createPoint end

"Well Known Text" is a simple text format defined by the Simple Feature for SQL specification:

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/geometry/GeometryExamples.java
  :language: java
  :start-after: // createPointWKT start
  :end-before: // createPointWKT end

If you need to represent many points (perhaps fence posts forming a fence) you can use use a MultiPoint.

Creating a LineString
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. image:: /images/geometry_linestring.png

The following makes a line string in the shape of a check mark::
   
   GeometryFactory geometryFactory = JTSFactoryFinder.getGeometryFactory( null );
   
   Coordinate[] coords  =
    new Coordinate[] {new Coordinate(0, 2), new Coordinate(2, 0), new Coordinate(8, 6) };
   
   LineString line = geometryFactory.createLineString(coordinates);

Alternative - Reading a LineString from WKT::
   
   GeometryFactory geometryFactory = JTSFactoryFinder.getGeometryFactory( null );
   
   WKTReader reader = new WKTReader( geometryFactory );
   LineString line = (LineString) reader.read("LINESTRING(0 2, 2 0, 8 6)");

If you need to represent a line with gaps in it you can use a MultiLineString.

Creating a Polygon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. image:: /images/geometry_polygon.png

The following makes a Polygon in the shape of a square::

   GeometryFactory geometryFactory = JTSFactoryFinder.getGeometryFactory( null );
   
   Coordinate[] coords  =
      new Coordinate[] {new Coordinate(4, 0), new Coordinate(2, 2),
                        new Coordinate(4, 4), new Coordinate(6, 2), new Coordinate(4, 0) };

   LinearRing ring = geometryFactory.createLinearRing( coords );
   LinearRing holes[] = null; // use LinearRing[] to represent holes
   Polygon polygon = geometryFactory.createPolygon(ring, holes );
   
Alternative - Reading a Polygon from WKT::
   
   GeometryFactory geometryFactory = JTSFactoryFinder.getGeometryFactory( null );
   
   WKTReader reader = new WKTReader( geometryFactory );
   Polygon polygon = (Polygon) reader.read("POLYGON((20 10, 30 0, 40 10, 30 20, 20 10))");

You can also create a Polygon will holes in it. And once again use a MultiPolygon to represent a single geometry made up of distinct shapes.


Arcs, Circles and Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JTS Topology Suite does not have any constructs to represent a "curve" or "circle" - it is strictly limited to geometry made up of straight (ie linear) lines.

In order to represent circles and curves you will need to produce them (yourself) using a little bit of math. If there is general interest in these kinds of functions we can add them to the GeoTools library.

Creating a Circle::

   private static Geometry createCircle(double x, double y, final double RADIUS) {
     GeometricShapeFactory shapeFactory = new GeometricShapeFactory();
     shapeFactory.setNumPoints(32);
     shapeFactory.setCentre(new Coordinate(x, y));
     shapeFactory.setSize(RADIUS * 2);
     return shapeFactory.createCircle();
   }

Even though "GeometricShapeFactory" is provided out of the box from JTS; there is nothing fancy about the code. It simply creates a series of coordinates in a circle.

Another approach is to create a curve or shape object with one of Java's handy Shape classes and then extract the coordinates from that object to create your geometry.

Arcs without the maths::
   
   private static Geometry createBezierCurve(Coordinate start,
                                             Coordinate end,
                                             Coordinate ctrlPoint1,
                                             Coordinate ctrlPoint2
                                             double smooth) {
       Shape curve = new CubicCurve2D.Double(
           start.x, start.y,
           ctrlPoint1.x, ctrlPoint1.y,
           ctrlPoint2.x, ctrlPoint2.y,
           end.x, end.y);
      
       // the value of the smooth arg determines how closely the line
       // segments between points approximate the smooth curve
       // (see javadocs for Shape.getPathIterator method)
      
       PathIterator iter = curve.getPathIterator(null, smooth);
      
       // a length 6 array is required for the iterator
       double[] iterBuf = new double[6];
   
       List<Coordinate> coords = new ArrayList<Coordinate>();
       while (!iter.isDone()) {
           iter.currentSegment(iterBuf);
           coords.add(new Coordinate(buf[0], buf[1]);
           iter.next();
       }
      
       GeometryFactory gf = new GeometryFactory();
       return gf.createLineString(coords.toArray(new Coordinate[coords.size()]));
   }

Here's an example of some randomly orientated and shaped curves generated in this way...

.. image:: /images/geometry_curve.gif

Sometimes you need to generate a smooth curve that is guaranteed to pass through a specified set of points. The tried and true approach here is to use a spline function. This generates a set of polynomial (cubic) curves, each of which fits a part of the data and joins smoothly to its neighbouring curves.

Splines::
   
   public Geometry splineInterpolatePoints(double[] xPoints, double[] yPoints) {
      /*
      * First we create a LineString of segments with the
      * input points as vertices.
      */
      final int N = xPoints.length;
      Coordinate[] coords = new Coordinate[N];
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
         coords[i] = new Coordinate(xPoints[i], yPoints[i]);
      }
      GeometryFactory gf = new GeometryFactory();
      LineString line = gf.createLineString(coords);
      
      /*
      * Now we use the GeoTools JTS utility class to smooth the
      * line. The returned Geometry will have all of the vertices
      * of the input line plus extra vertices tracing a spline
      * curve. The second argument is the 'fit' parameter which
      * can be in the range 0 (loose fit) to 1 (tightest fit).
      */
      return JTS.smooth(line, 0.0);
   }

Here is an example of this in use:

.. image:: /images/geometry_spline1.png

Example smoothing a polygon::
  
  WKTReader reader = new WKTReader();
  Geometry tShape = reader.read(
  "POLYGON((10 0, 10 20, 0 20, 0 30, 30 30, 30 20, 20 20, 20 0, 10 0))");
  
  Geometry tLoose = JTS.smooth(tShape, 0.0);
  Geometry tTighter = JTS.smooth(tShape, 0.75);

Here is the resulting image:

Geometry
^^^^^^^^

Using Geometry is pretty straight forward, although a little intimidating when starting out due to the number of methods.


.. image:: /images/geometry_use.PNG

Some summary information is available:

* getArea() - area returned in the same units as the coordinates (be careful of lat/lon data!)
* getCentroid() - the centre of the geometry
* getEnvelope() - returns a geometry which is probably not what you wanted
* getEnvelopeInternal() - this returns a useful Envelope
* getInteriorPoint() - the centre of the geometry (that is actually on the geometry)
* getDimension()

Geometry relationships are represented by the following functions returning true or false:

* disjoint(Geometry) - same as "not" intersects
* touches(Geometry) - geometry have to just touch, crossing or overlap will not work
* intersects(Geometry)
* crosses(Geometry)
* within(Geometry) - geometry has to be full inside 
* contains(Geometry)
* overlaps(Geometry) - has to actually overlap the edge, being within or touching will not work
* covers(Geometry)
* coveredBy(Geometry)
* relate(Geometry, String) - allows general check of relationship see dim9 page
* relate(Geometry)

To actually determine a shape based on two geometry:

* intersection(Geometry)
* union(Geometry)
* difference(Geometry)
* symDifference(Geometry)

Some of the most helpful functions are:

* distance( Geometry )
* buffer(double) - used to buffer the edge of a geometry to produce a polygon
* union() - used on a geometry collection to produce a single geometry

The tree most difficult methods are here (they will be discussed in detail):

* equals( Object ) - normal Java equals which checks that the two objects are the same instance
* equals( Geometry ) - checks if the geometry is the same shape
* equalsExact( Geometry ) - check if the data structure is the same
 
There are some book keeping methods to help discovery how the geometry was constructed:

* getGeometryFactory()
* getPreceisionModel()
* toText() - the WKT representation of the Geometry
* getGeoemtryType() - factory method called (ie "point", "linestring", etc..)

A couple of methods are there to store your developer information:

* getSRID() - stores the "spatial reference id", used as an external key when working with databases
* getUserData() - intended to be used by developers, a best practice is to store a java.util.Map. GeoTools will occasionally use this field to store a "srsName" or full CoordianteReferenceSystem. 

Geometries Enum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code that makes use of Geometry ends up doing a fair amount of "instanceof" testing in order to determine what kind of Geometry is being used (to take appropriate action).

We have an enumeration defined to help out in this case:
    
   .. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/geometry/GeometryExamples.java
      :language: java
      :start-after: // geometries start
      :end-before: // geometries end

PrecisionModel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Out of the box JTS works with a default double precision model. Configuring your GeometryFactory with a PrecisionModel allows you to work at a different resolution than this default.

PrecisionModel forms the heart of "numerical stability" when working with Geometry. When working with large values the mathematics built into Java are not very accurate. By explicitly capturing the "round-off" process in a PrecisionModel JTS allows to manage these sorts of errors and make an appropriate tradeoff of speed vs accuracy for your work.

* Round-off often occur, even when working in double precision.
  
  Especially if you are working in a coordinate system with big
  numbers and you're a long way from the origin.

* The other reason to look at PrecisionModel is to ensure it matches
  your final use for your data. If you know you are only going to
  display an answer on the screen, you may be able to get by with
  reduced precision.
  
  By matching the PrecisionModel with your expected use, certain long
  running operations (that need to converge on an answer) can stop
  when they have reached the level of detail you expect. No sense
  doing extra work for more significant digits if the result is going
  to be rounded off at the end of the day.

The following code example takes into account that the location being passed in was only supplied as a floating point value x/y. We handle this by creating this test point with a GeometryFactory that takes a PrecisionModel argument. The test point will be flagged as having a certain limited precision and all JTS operations will take this into account.

There are various ways of specifying a PrecisionModel but here we base it on the number of decimal places to use for coordinate comparisons.::
  
  private boolean polyContains(Polygon poly, float x, float y, int numDecPlaces) {
    double scale = Math.pow(10, numDecPlaces);
    PrecisionModel pm = new PrecisionModel(scale);
    GeometryFactory gf = new GeometryFactory(pm);
    
    Geometry testPoint = gf.createPoint(new Coordinate(x, y));
    return poly.contains(testPoint);
  }

You can also define the PrecisionModel using a couple of constants::

   pm = new PrecisionModel( PrecisionModel.Type.FIXED ); // fixed decimal point
   pm = new PrecisionModel( PrecisionModel.Type.FLOATING ); // for Java double
   pm = new PrecisionModel( PrecisionModel.Type.FLOATING_SINGLE ); // for Java float


This is an advanced feature that is not often used.

CoordinateSequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may wish to provide a custom CoordinateSequenceFactory for reasons of efficiency and/or reducing memory use.

Internally Geometry often works with Coordinate[]. However many of the spatial formats used for JTS will store values as a flat doube[] or float[] for efficiency. By implementing a CoordinateSequenceFactory GeoTools can teach JTS how to handle the values directly out of a shapefile for example.

This is an advanced feature that is not often used.

JTS
^^^

Some of the code examples used above reference the *JTS* utility class. This class is provided by **gt-api** module; and contains many helpful methods for working with Geometry.
