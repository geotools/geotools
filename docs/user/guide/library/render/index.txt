This is most likely the reason you are interested in the GeoTools library - this module finally lets you draw a map using all that data you set up.

* SLD?
  
  The Style Layer Descriptor Specification is an OGC standard
  defining styles used when drawing maps. Think of it as CSS for maps.
  
  GeoTools rendering is based around the Style Layer Descriptor standard,
  for details please see the gt-opengis  module.
  
  This standard is divided into two parts:
  
  * Style Layer Descriptor 1.1 covers the integration of styles
    with a web map server.
  
  * Symbology Encoding 1.1 covers the definition of a feature type style
    controlling how a rendering engine draws features.

* Q: What is a MapContext
  
  This module actually defines a new data structure - MapContext. A  
  MapContext is made up of a series of MapLayers which are drawn in
  order.
  
  This is not part of the formal gt-opengis module because it is not
  considered finished, done, or complete. The GeoTools community is
  actively looking to collaborate with other projects (such as OpenJUMP,
  uDig and deegree) in order to collaborate on these ideas. If open 
  source collaboration fails we will look to traditional collaboration
  with a standards body in the form of the the OGC working group on "Open
  Web Context" documents.

* Q: What about the Widget?
  
  This module only draws into a Graphics2D context (so printer or image
  buffer). You can use this functionality in your own Swing widget in
  order to draw something on screen.
  
  * gt-swing
    
    GeoTools does not provide comprehensive GUI components but there is a
    basic Swing widget JMapFrame in the **gt-swing** module which is used
    in GeoTools example code. This can be used directly in your
    applications or it could form the starting point for writing your own
    Swing components. See JMapFrame for more details.
  
  * gt-swt
    
    The gt-swing JMapFrame has been ported to an SWT widget as an 
    unsupported module.
  
  * udig
    
    uDig is an application and SDK built around the Eclipse platform,
    please consider this a real world solution suitable for desktop
    applications. It makes use of the SWT toolkit so while you can use it
    as an example of how to do really fast rendering you will not be able
    to directly use the code in a swing application.
