Internal
--------

This page is devoted to the internals of the API package; in this particular case (since gt-api
mosty consists of interfaces) there is not a lot of interesting design elements to discuss.

Check

* |star| IP:
  Reivew is `available <http://svn.osgeo.org/geotools/trunk/modules/library/api/src/site/apt/review.apt>`_
* |star|
  Releasible: no blocking issues in Jira
* |star| Quality Assurance:
  Primiarly interfaces results in low amount of code coverage; code
  contains one known warning (reference to deprecated FeatureLockFactory)
* |star| Stability:
  The interfaces here are stable and subject to review and discussion before being
  considered for the gt-api module.
* |star| Supported:
  User documentation is available, module maintainer follows the user and devel lists.

Recent Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For the 2.2.x branch the API was created to isolate geotools interfaces from implementation.
* For the 2.3.x branch some modification was made to support the use of Expressions against
  more then just features.
* For the 2.4.x
* For 2.5.x the feature model code was removed (and replaced by gt-opengis feature model)
* For 2.6.x Parameter was isoalted from DataStoreFactorySPI.Param in orde to be reused
  by gt-process code.
* For 2.7.x the style interfaces were updated to be a read/write reflection of gt-opengis style
  interfaces. In additional several interfaces such as Query and FeaureLock were changed to
  be normal classes.

Status
^^^^^^

Here is what the module can tell you right now about GeoTools:

* the API here is pretty good, based on a specification and so on
* for work like Filter or Styling you will see a migration plan to stable geoapi interfaces
* for work like DataStore it represents an API we are happy with

And here is what you will not see:

* Any "FactoryFinder" or any geotools "glue" code that covers for lack of consistency
* Code that patches the API usability - such as DataUtilities

Build
^^^^^

There are no special build requirements.
