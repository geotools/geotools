netCDF Plugin
-------------

The NetCDF plugin supports gridded NetCDF files having dimensions following the COARDS convention (custom, Time, Elevation, Lat, Lon). The NetCDF plugin supports plain NetCDF datasets (.nc files) as well .ncml files (which aggregate and/or modify one or more datasets) and Feature Collections. It supports Forecast Model Run Collection Aggregations (FMRC) either through the NCML or Feature Collection syntax. It supports an unlimited amount of custom dimensions, including runtime.
