Internally ``gt-shape`` provides a two implementations at this time; one for simple access and another that supports the use of an index. The factory will
be able to sort out which one is appropriate when using ``DataStoreFinder`` or
``FileDataStoreFinder``.

Shapefile
^^^^^^^^^

A Shapefile is a common file format which contains numerous features of the same type. Each shapefile has a single feature type.

The classic three files:

* ``filename.shp``: shapes
* ``filename.shx``: shapes to attributes index
* ``filename.dbf``: attributes

Basic metadata:
* ``filename.prj``: projection

Open source extensions:

* ``filename.qix``: quadtree spatial index
* ``filename.fix``: feature id index
* ``filename.sld``: Styled Layer Descriptor style XML object

ESRI proprietary extensions (ignored by GeoTools):

* ``filename.sbn``: attribute index
* ``filename.sbx``: spatial index
* ``filename.lyr``: ArcMap-only style object
* ``filename.avl``: ArcView style object
* ``filename.shp.xml``: FGDC metadata

This style of file format (from the dawn of time) is referred to as "sidecar" files, at a minimum file ``filename.shp`` and its sidecar file ``filename.dbf`` are needed. 

Access
''''''

Working with an Existing Shapefile:

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/data/ShapefileExample.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // start use
   :end-before: // end use


Creating
''''''''

Here is a quick example:

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/data/ShapefileExample.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // start create
   :end-before: // end create

The ``featureType`` created above was just done quickly, in your application you may wish to use a ``DefaultFeatureTypeBuilder``.

Supports:

* attribute names must be 15 characters or you will get a warning:
* a single geometry column named ``the_geom`` (stored in the ``SHP`` file)
  * ``LineString``, ``MultiLineString`` 
  * ``Polygon``, ``MultiPolygon`` 
  * ``Point``, ``MultiPoint``
  
  Geometries can also contain a measure (M) value or  Z & M values.

* "simple" attributes (stored in the DBF file)
  
  * String  max length of 255
  * Integer
  * Double 
  * Boolean
  * Date - ``TimeStamp`` interpretation that is just the date

Limitations:

* only work with ``MultiLineStrings``, ``MultiPolygon`` or ``MultiPoint``. GIS data often travels
  in herds - so being restricted to the plural form is not a great limitation.
* only work with fixed length strings (you will find the ``FeatureType``
  has a restriction to help you check this, and warnings will be produced if
  your content ends up trimmed).
* Only supports a single ``GeometryAttribute``
* Shapefile does not support plain Geometry (i.e. mixed ``LineString``, ``Point`` and ``Polygon`` all in the same file).
* The shapefile maximum size is limited to 2GB (its sidecar DBF file often to 2GB, some system being able
  to read 4GB or more)
* Dates do not support the storage of time by default. If you must store time
  stamps and do **not** need interoperability then you can enable the storage of
  time in date columns by setting the system property
  ``org.geotools.shapefile.datetime`` to "true". **Almost no other program will
  be able to read these files.**

Dumping almost anything into a shapefile
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In case the feature collection to be turned into a shapefile is not
fitting the shapefile format limitations it's still possible to create
shapefiles out of it, at ease, leaving all the structural bridging work
to the ``ShapefileDumper`` class.

In particular, given one or more feature collections, the dumper will:

* Reduce attribute names to the DBF accepted length, making sure there are not conflicts (counters being added at the end of the attribute name to handle this).
* Fan out multiple geometry type into parallel shapefiles, named after the original feature type, plus the geometry type as a suffix.
* Fan out multiple shapefiles in case the maximum size is reached.

Example usage:

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/data/ShapefileExample.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // start dumper
   :end-before: // end dumper

Force Projection
''''''''''''''''

If you run the above code, and then load the result in a GIS application like ArcMap it will complain that the projection is unknown.

You can "force" the projection using the following code::
  
  CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = CRS.decode("EPSG:4326");
  shape.forceSchemaCRS( crs );

This is only a problem if you did not specify the ``CoordinateReferenceSystem`` as part of your ``FeatureType``'s ``GeometryAttribute``, or if a ``prj`` file has not been provided.

Character Sets
''''''''''''''

If you are working with Arabic, Chinese or Korean character sets you will need to make use of the ``charset`` connection parameter when setting up your shapefile. The codes used here are the same as documented/defined for the Java ``Charset`` class. Indeed you can provide a ``Charset`` or if you provide a String it will be converted to a ``Charset``.

Thanks to the University of Seoul for providing and testing this functionality.

Timezone
''''''''

The store will build dates using the default timezone. If you need to work against meteorological data the timezone has normally to be forced to "UTC" instead.


Reading PRJ
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the CRS utility class to read the ``PRJ`` file if required. The contents of the file are in "well known text"::
  
  CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = CRS.parseWKT(wkt);

Reading DBF
^^^^^^^^^^^

A shapefile is actually comprised of a core ``shp`` file and a number of "sidecar" files. One of the sidecar files is a ``dbf`` file used to record attributes. This is the original DBF file format provided by one of the original grandfather databases "DBase III".

.. literalinclude:: /../src/main/java/org/geotools/data/ShapefileExample.java
   :language: java
   :start-after: // start read
   :end-before: // end read

The GeoTools library includes just enough DBF file format support to get out of bed in the morning; indeed you should considered these facilities an internal detail to our shapefile reading code.

Thanks to Larry Reeder form the user list for supplying the following code example::
  
  // Here's an example that should work (warning, I haven't
  // tried to compile this).  The example assumes the first field has a
  // character data type and the second has a numeric data type:
  
  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream( "yourfile.dbf" );
  DbaseFileReader dbfReader =  new DbaseFileReader(fis.getChannel(),
  false,  Charset.forName("ISO-8859-1"));
  
  while ( dbfReader.hasNext() ){
     final Object[] fields = dbfReader.readEntry();
     
     String field1 = (String) fields[0];
     Integer field2 = (Integer) fields[1];
     
     System.out.println("DBF field 1 value is: " + field1);
     System.out.println("DBF field 2 value is: " + field2);
  }
  
  dbfReader.close();
  fis.close();
