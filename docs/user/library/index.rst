The GeoTools library is organized into a series of jars. These jars form a software stack,
each building on the services of the others. Individual jars such as ``gt-jdbc`` are extended
with plugins in order to support additional capabilities. For ``gt-jdbc`` these plugins include
support for common spatial databases such as ``gt-jdbc-postgis`` to support the PostGIS database.
