Internals
---------

The gt-main class holds a number of internal and abstract classes useful to those implementing support for additional DataStore formats.
These classes should be moved to gt-data when time permits.

he gt-main module provides many well known classes covered in the public documentation:

* DataAccessFinder
* DataStoreFinder
* FileDataStoreFinder
* DataUtilities
* DefaultRepository
* DefaultTransaction
* DefaultView

A few public exceptions:

* FeatureLockException
* SchemaNotFoundException

And a couple that are no longer used:

* DefaultFeatureLock
* DefaultFeatureLockFactory
* DefaultQuery

AbstractDataStore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **AbstractDataStore** is an old base class for DataStore implementations, currently used only by MemoryDataStore and PropertyDataStore. All new stores use **ContentDataStore** instead.

.. image:: /images/AbstractDataStore.PNG

This class is helpful starting point, however we have taken the lessons learned and wrapped them up in ContentDataStore covered in the :doc:`gt-data <../data/internal>` documentation.

The following classes are related:

* AbstractDataStore
* AbstractDataStoreFactory
* AbstractDataStoreTest
* AbstractFeatureSource
* AbstractFeatureStore
* AbstractFeatureLocking
* DefaultFeatureResults - the original name of FeatureCollection was FeatureResults!Simpl

DataStore
^^^^^^^^^

There are a large number of DataStore helper classes in gt-main.

* Default implementations:
  
  * DefaultResourceInfo
  * DefaultServiceInfo

* FileDataStore
  
  * AbstractFileDataStore

* Conformance test case:
  
  * DataTestCase

* Managers
  
  These managers, with their supporting readers and writers are responsible for AbstractDataStore being able
  wrap transaction and locking support around you work.
  
  * FeatureListenerManager
  * InProcessLockingManager

* Transaction Implementation
  
  You can store a TransactionStateDiff in a Transaction, the DiffFeatureReader and DiffFeatureWriters will collect any changes for you
  in memory which you can review when the user calls commit.

  * TransactionStateDiff
  * Diff
  * DiffFeatureReader
  * DiffFeatureWriter

* Projection File
  
  * PrjFileReader
  * WorldFileReader
  * WorldFileWriter

FeatureCollection
'''''''''''''''''

Lots of abstract and utility classes are available when working with FeatureCollection:

* AbstractFeatureCollection.
* AbstractFeatureVisitor
* AdaptorFeatureCollection
* DecoratingFeatureCollection
* DecoratingSimpleFeatureCollection
* DelegateFeatureIterator
* DelegateSimpleFeatureIterator
* FilteringSimpleFeatureCollection
* MaxSimpleFeatureCollection
* SubFeatureCollection / FilteredIterator
* SubFeatureList

FeatureCollections often form a pair with the iterator they use to make contents available:
* DataFeatureCollection / FeatureWriterIterator / FeatureReaderIterator
* EmptyFeatureCollection / EmptyIterator
* FilteringFeatureCollection / FilteringFeatureIterator
* MaxFeaturesFeatureCollection / MaxFeaturesIterator
* ReprojectingFeatureCollection / ReprojectingIterator
* ReTypingFeatureCollection / ReTypingIterator

And the lower level iterator helpers:

* SimpleFeatureIteratorImpl - used by DefaultFeatureCollection to access all contents
* FeatureIteratorImpl
* NoContentIterator - used to throw an exception on next()
* FilteringIterator
* FeatureIteratorIterator
* FeatureReaderFeatureIterator
* FeatureWriterFeatureIterator

FeatureReader
'''''''''''''

Low-level implementation support for implementing FeatureReader.

* DefaultFeatureReader
* DefaultFIDReader
* EmptyFeatureReader
* EmptyFeatureWriter

These readers wrap around your simple FeatureReader and add additional functionality such as filtering:

* DelegatingFeatureReader
* DelegatingFeatureWriter
* FIDFeatureReader
* FIDReader
* FilteringFeatureReader
* FilteringFeatureWriter
* MaxFeatureReader
* ReTypeFeatureReader
* ForceCoordinateSystemFeatureReader
* ForceCoordinateSystemFeatureResults
* ReprojectFeatureReader
* ReprojectFeatureResults

A few even work on iterators:

* CollectionFeatureReader
* ForceCoordinateSystemIterator
* ReprojectFeatureIterator

Where general facilities are available we need SimpleFeature implementations:

* DelegateSimpleFeatureReader
* DelegatingSimpleFeatureWriter
* EmptySimpleFeatureReader
* FilteringSimpleFeatureReader

AttributeReader
'''''''''''''''

Sub-zero: These are not used in practice they were intended to be used for attribute level operations; in practice everyone works
directly with features. The only place where they are used is with the Shapefile implementation where they are used to "join" the attributes
from the shp and dbf files.

* AbstractAttributeIO
* AttributeReader
* AttributeWriter
* JoiningAttributeReader
* JoiningAttributeWriter

Wrappers
''''''''

Wrappers used by DataUtilities to morph to SimpelFeatureSource, SimpleFeatureCollection etc...

* SimpleFeatureCollectionBridge
* SimpleFeatureLockingBridge
* SimpleFeatureSourceBridge
* SimpleFeatureStoreBridge

Open Web Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the data structures used by open web services such as WMS and WFS are defined here, when we are happy with them
they will be published as part of gt-api.

XML
^^^

Some of the SAX, DOM and Transform classes for handling are defined in gt-main.

Their use for XML and GML handling will be covered in gt-xml.
