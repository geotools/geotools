OpenGIS
=======

Interfaces for GeoSpatial concepts, often defined by the OGC or ISO standards bodies. The interfaces
in this module serve as a great reference if you do not have the time to purchase and read
the official standards documents. Approach the standards using an environment you
are comfortable with - Java!

GeoTools is all about implementing spatial solutions, and we do our very best to follow a don't
invent here policy (rather than get off topic). By referencing standards we are able to use well
understood names for common spatial ideas and constructs.

The *gt-opengis* module provides:

* interfaces implemented by :doc:`gt-main <../main/index>` such as Feature, FeatureType, Filter and Function
* interfaces implemented by :doc:`gt-coverage <../coverage/index>` such as GridCoverage
* interfaces implemented by :doc:`gt-referencing <../referencing/index>` such as CoordinateReferenceSystem
* interfaces implemented by :doc:`gt-metadata <../metadata/index>` such as Citation

For more information on the standards covered by the library as whole: :ref:`standards`
