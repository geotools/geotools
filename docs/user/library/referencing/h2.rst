EPSG H2 Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin works out of the box (as a pure java database with its own copy of the EPSG database included).

To use place the gt-epsg-h2 jar on your CLASSPATH.

Although this plugin is not supported, it is a drop in replacement for the gt-epsg-hsql plugin and is well suited if you are already using h2 and do not want a second pure java database dependency in your application.
