EPSG H2 Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin works out of the box (as a pure java database with its own copy of the EPSG database included).

To use place the ``gt-epsg-h2`` jar on your CLASSPATH.

Although this plugin is not supported, it is a drop in replacement for the ``gt-epsg-hsql`` plugin and is well suited if you are already using H2 and do not want a second pure java database dependency in your application.
