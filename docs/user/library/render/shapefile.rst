Shapefile Renderer
------------------

An implementation of GTRender that has been extened with 
shapefile specific opimisations. It will call
GTRender for any layers that are not a shapefile.

Most of the optimizations that were prototyped in
gt-shapefile have been brought back into gt-render.

As such this module is no longer under development.
