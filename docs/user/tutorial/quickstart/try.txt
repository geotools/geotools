Each tutorial consists of very detailed steps followed by a series of extra questions. If you get
stuck at any point please ask your instructor; or sign up to the geotools-users_ email list.

Here are some additional challenges for you to try:

* Try out the different sample data sets.

* Zoom in, zoom out and show the full extent and use the info tool to examine individual
  countries in the sample ``countries.shp`` file.

* Download the largest shapefile you can find and see how quickly it can be rendered. You should
  find that the very first time it will take a while as a spatial index is generated. After that
  rendering will become much faster.
  
* Fast: We know that one of the ways people select a spatial library is based on speed. By design
  GeoTools does not load the above shapefile into memory (instead it streams it off of disk
  each time it is drawn using a spatial index to only bring the content required for display).
  
  If you would like to ask GeoTools to cache the shapefile in memory try the following code:

  .. literalinclude:: /../../tutorials/quickstart/src/main/java/org/geotools/tutorial/quickstart/QuickstartCache.java
     :language: java
     :start-after: // docs start cache
     :end-before:  // docs end cache
  
  For the above example to compile you will need to add the necessary imports.

  .. Note::

     When building you may see a message that ``CachingFeatureSource`` is deprecated. It's OK to ignore
     it, it's just a warning. The class is still under test but usable.

..  The ability to figure out what classes to import is a key skill; we are
    starting off here with a simple example with a single import.

* Try and sort out what all the different "side car" files are – and what they are for. The sample
  data set includes ``shp``, ``dbf`` and ``shx``. How many other side car files are there?

  .. This exercise asks users to locate the geotools user guide or wikipedia
 
* Advanced: The use of ``FileDataStoreFinder`` allows us to work easily with files. The other way to do
  things is with a map of connection parameters. This techniques gives us a little more control over
  how we work with a shapefile and also allows us to connect to databases and web feature servers.

  .. literalinclude:: /../../tutorials/quickstart/src/main/java/org/geotools/tutorial/quickstart/QuickstartNotes.java
     :language: java
     :start-after: // start datastore
     :end-before:  // end datastore

* Important: GeoTools is an active open source project – you can quickly use maven to try out the
  latest nightly build by changing your :file:`pom.xml` file to use a ``SNAPSHOT`` release.
  
  At the time of writing |branch|-SNAPSHOT is under active development.
  
  | <properties>
  |   <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
  |   <geotools.version>|branch|-SNAPSHOT</geotools.version>
  | </properties>

  Double check your :file:`pom.xml` file to include the OSGeo snapshot repository:
  
  .. literalinclude:: /../../tutorials/quickstart/pom.xml
     :language: xml
     :start-at: <repositories>
     :end-at: </repositories>
  
  You can check the status of the build server producing current |branch|-SNAPSHOT here:
