Open Source
-----------

GeoTools is proud to be one of the original founding projects of the 
`Open Source Geospatial Foundation <https://osgeo.org>`__. The foundation holds
the copyright on the library and is a wonderful source of assistance and
community spirit for our project. The GeoTools library is made available under
the `LGPL <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>`_ license. The source code
is freely available in a public 
`GIT repository <https://github.com/geotools/geotools>`_.

Open Development
----------------

If your organization is making use of GeoTools we invite you to participate directly. Sign up to the 
`developers mailing list <http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4091>`_ for details on our online meetings.

GeoTools follows an open development process. Project policies and procedures are
documented in the Developers Guide. Both our change proposals and 
`issue tracker <https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/projects/GEOT>`_ are open.
