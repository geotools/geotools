============

There are a number of ways one can contribute to the GeoTools project.

Participation
-------------

* Mailing Lists:
  
  The  `users list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-gt2-users>`__
  is the place to go when you have questions about using GeoTools. Have a look at our
  :user:`user list posting guide <welcome/userlistguide.html>`
  and join in the discussion.

  The `developer list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-devel>`__
  is restricted to discussions that pertaining to the actual
  development of the GeoTools library. If you have a patch you would like to 
  contribute, or an issue with a plug-in you are working on, discuss it on this 
  list. This is list is also open to anyone who would like to take part in the
  day to day development activities.

  The `administration list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geotools-administration>`__
  is for the care and feeding of the GeoTools project.

* Bug Tracker
  
  GeoTools uses a `JIRA <https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/projects/GEOT>`_ issue tracker to manage
  bugs, issues, and new features. If you have found a bug, or if there is a feature that you would
  like to see implemented in GeoTools, please report it in JIRA.

  policies, procedures and build environment for the GeoTools project. If you have
