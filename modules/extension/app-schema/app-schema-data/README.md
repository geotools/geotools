# Application Schema Sample Data

Used to build sample data into maven artifacts so they can be used
for integration testing.

This module should not be part of the standard build.
Modules below have no parent, by design.

Once artifacts are built with ``mvn clean install``, selected
artifacts can be deployed to the osgeo GeoTools maven repository.
