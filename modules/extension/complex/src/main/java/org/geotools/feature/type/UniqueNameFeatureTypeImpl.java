/**
 * A specialisation of {@link FeatureTypeImpl} that avoids equality tests on feature types with
 * cyclic definitions by considering features types to be equal if and only if their names are
 * equal.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * Users of this class must not create multiple instances with the same name unless they represent
 * the same type, because other parts of the implementation will assume they are equal, and if they
 * are not, Bad Things Will Happen.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * It should be noted that app-schema does not support the multiple definition XSD types with the
 * same name. This restriction allows multiple XSD elements and thus WFS feature types (with
 * different names) to have the same XSD type, because the XSD type can be recognised by name even
 * if it has a cyclic definition. This simplified equality testing allows {@link FeatureTypeCache}
 * to handle these types, despite their cyclic definition preventing a full recursive implementation
 * of {@link #equals(Object)}equals(). Unit test coverage is in GeoServer app-schema-test
 * DuplicateTypeTest.
