/**
 * An implementation of GraphGenerator used to generate directed graphs. Graphs are generated as
 * follows:<br>
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Objects added to the generator are 2 element object arrays.
 *   <LI>The elements of the array represent the objects modelled by the nodes.
 *   <LI>The object array itself is the object modelled by the edges.
 *   <LI>As each object array is added to the generator:
 *       <UL>
 *         <LI>A node lookup table is queried using the elements of the object array.
 *         <LI>If a node lookup returns null, a new node is created for its respective object.
 *         <LI>A new edge is created incident to the two looked up nodes.
 *         <LI>The underlying object of the edge is set to the be object array.
 *       </UL>
 * </UL>
