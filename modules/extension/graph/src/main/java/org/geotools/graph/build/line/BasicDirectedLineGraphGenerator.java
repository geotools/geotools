/**
 * An implementation of GraphGenerator used to generate a graph representing a directed line
 * network. Graphs are generated by supplying the generator with objects of type LineSegment via the
 * add(Object) method. <br>
 * <br>
 * For each line segment added, an edge in the graph is created. The builder records the end
 * coordinates of each line added, and maintains a map of coordinates to nodes, creating nodes when
 * neccessary.<br>
 * <br>
 * Edges created by the generator are of type BasicDirectedEdge and contain an object of type
 * LineSegment.<br>
 * Nodes created by the generator are of type BasicDirectedXYNode and contain an object of type
 * Coordinate.
