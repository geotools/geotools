/**
 * An implementation of GraphReaderWriter used for reading and writing graph objects to and from a
 * database. <br>
 * <br>
 * Upon reading, the database is queried using the getQuery() template method, and a representation
 * of the objects to be modelled by the graph are returned through a standard ResultSet. From each
 * tuple in the result set, the object is recreated via the template method readInternal(ResultSet).
 * The object is then passed to an underlying graph generator and the graph components used to model
 * the object are constructed.<br>
 * <br>
 * Upon writing, the graph is read component by component based on set properties. If the NODES
 * property is set, nodes will be written. If the EDGES property is set, edges will be written as
 * well. As each component is processed, it is passed to the repspective template methods
 * writeNode(Statement,Node) and writeEdge(Statement,Edge). The methods then execute a statement to
 * create the database representation of the graph component.
