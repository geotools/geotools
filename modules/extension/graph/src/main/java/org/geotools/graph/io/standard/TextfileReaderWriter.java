/**
 * An implementation of GraphReaderWriter that reads/writes graphs from/to text
 * files. Each line of the text file represents an object to be modelled by 
 * the graph.
 * <BR>
 * When performing a read, the text file is read line by line. As each line
 * is read it is tokenized based on the delimiter property, and passed to the 
 * template method readInternal(StringTokenizer), which must be implemented
 * by a subclass. The method returns the object that is to be represented in 
 * the graph. The returned object is then passed to an underlying GraphGenerator
 * which creates the necessary graph components to modell the object.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * When performing a write, the graph is read component by component based
 * on set properties. If the NODES property is set, nodes will be written. If
 * the EDGES property is set, edges will be written as well. As each component
 * is processed, it is passed to the repspective template methods 
 * writeNode(Writer,Node) and writeEdge(Writer,Edge). The methods then write
 * out the text representation of the component.
