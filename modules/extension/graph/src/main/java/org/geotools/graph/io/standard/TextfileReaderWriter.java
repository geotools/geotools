/**
 * An implementation of GraphReaderWriter that reads/writes graphs from/to text files. Each line of
 * the text file represents an object to be modelled by the graph. <br>
 * When performing a read, the text file is read line by line. As each line is read it is tokenized
 * based on the delimiter property, and passed to the template method readInternal(StringTokenizer),
 * which must be implemented by a subclass. The method returns the object that is to be represented
 * in the graph. The returned object is then passed to an underlying GraphGenerator which creates
 * the necessary graph components to modell the object.<br>
 * <br>
 * When performing a write, the graph is read component by component based on set properties. If the
 * NODES property is set, nodes will be written. If the EDGES property is set, edges will be written
 * as well. As each component is processed, it is passed to the repspective template methods
 * writeNode(Writer,Node) and writeEdge(Writer,Edge). The methods then write out the text
 * representation of the component.
