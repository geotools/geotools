/**
 * Represents a directed graph.
 *
 * <p>In a directed graph, components have an explicit direction associated with them. <br>
 * <br>
 * Directed nodes differentiate between those adjacent edges that originate at them (outgoing edges
 * ) and those that terminate at them (incoming edges).<br>
 * <br>
 * Directed edges differentiate between the node at the the source of the edge (source node) and the
 * node at the destination of the edges (destination node).<br>
 * <br>
 * The following is a figure of an undirected graph, and one of the possible directed graphs that
 * can be derived from it. Directionality is indicated by arrow heads on the edges of the graph.<br>
