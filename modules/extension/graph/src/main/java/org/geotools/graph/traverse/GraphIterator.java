/**
 * Defines an algorithm in which to traverse the components of a graph. A graph iterator operates by
 * repeatedly returing graph components to the caller. The order in which to return the components
 * is specific to the iterator. However, <B>most</B> iterators follow the following conventions:<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Components are visited only once
 *   <LI>The next component to be returned is determined by the components that have been previously
 *       visited
 * </UL>
 *
 * The following is an example of a GraphIterator. It returns nodes of a graph in a standard
 * <B>Depth First Search</B> order, starting from a specified node. The nodes have been numbered to
 * correspond to the iteration pattern. <br>
 * <br>
 * <IMG src="doc-files/dfs.gif"/> * indicates source of traversal<br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * In order to analyze the traversal, the following terms are defined:<br>
 * <br>
 * The <B>Next Set</B> of a traversal is the set of components that will be visited in a later stage
 * of the traversal.<br>
 * The <B>Branch Set</B> of an component <B>e</B> is defined as the set of components that can be
 * visited in a later stage of the traversal as a direct result of visiting <B>e</B>. <br>
 * <br>
 * In most traversals, the two sets are related. The Next Set is built by analyzing the Branch Set
 * of the component being visited in the current stage of the traversal. Revisiting the above
 * example, a Depth First Search Traversal operates as follows:<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Each node is visited only once.
 *   <LI>The Next Set is organized as a <B>Last In First Out</B> Queue (Stack).
 *   <LI>At each stage, every node in the Branch Set that has not yet been visited is added to the
 *       Next Set.
 * </UL>
 *
 * As well it is assumed that nodes related to a node are sorted in alphabetic order. <br>
 * <br>
 * The following table summarizes the stages of the traversal:<br>
 * <br>

 * At any stage of a travesal a branch may be <B>killed</B>.When a branch is killed at a stage of an

 * node B. The following table summarizes the stages of the traversal:<br>
