/**
 * Iterates a GraphWalker over the components of a Graph. The order in which components are iterated
 * over is determined by the GraphIterator class. The GraphTraversal is the mediator between the
 * GraphWalker and the GraphIterator.<br>
 * <br>
 * Upon each visitation, the GraphWalker communicates to the GraphTraversal through a series of
 * return codes, each specifying a different action to perform at that point of the travesal. The
 * following summarizes the meaning of the codes.<br>

 *   <TR>
 *     <TD align="center">CONTINUE</TD>
 *     <TD>The traversal continues as normal.</TD>
 *   </TR>
 *  <TR>
 *     <TD align="center"f>SUSPEND</TD>
 *     <TD>Suspends the traversal at some intermediate stage. This code
 *         should be returned if the traversal is intended to be resumed.</TD>
 *  </TR>
 *  <TR>
 *     <TD align="center">KILL_BRANCH</TD>
 *     <TD>Kills the current branch of the traversal. Depending on the iteration
 *         algorithm, returning this code may end the traversal.</TD>

 * GraphTraversals are started with a call to traverse(). If the traversal is suspended at some
 * intermediate point, an additional call to traverse() will resume the traversal.<br>
