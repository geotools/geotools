/**
 * Iterates over the nodes of a graph in <B>Depth First Topological Sort</B> pattern. The following
 * is an illustration of the iteration.<br>
 * <IMG src="doc-files/depth_topo.gif"><br>
 * <br>
 * Initially all nodes of degree less than two are <B>active</B> (ready to be visited). As nodes are
 * visited, a node can become active when all but one of its related nodes have been visited (
 * degree = counter + 1). When a node becomes active it is placed into the <B>active node queue</B>
 * (queue of nodes to be visited). The Depth First Topological iterator places nodes into the queue
 * in <B>Last In First Out</B> order (a Stack).<br>
 * <br>
 * To determine when a node is to become active the iterator uses the counter associated with each
 * node. If these counters are modified by an entity other then the iterator, the iteration may be
 * affected in undefined ways.
