/**
 * Defined a per Feature validation test.
 *
 * <p>Each ValidationPlugIn is very specific in nature: it performs one test extermly well. This
 * simplifies design decisions, documenation configuration and use.
 *
 * <p>Following the lead the excelent design work in the JUnit testing framework validation results
 * are collected by a ValidationResults object. This interface for the ValidationResults object also
 * allows it to collect warning information.
 *
 * <p>The PlugIn is also required to supply some metadata to aid in its deployment, scripting,
 * logging and execution and error recovery:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>name: user's name of validation test
 *   <li>description: user's description of validation test
 *   <li>priority: used to schedule validation test
 *   <li>typeNames: used to connect validaiton test to transaction opperation
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Capabilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Uses FeatureResults to allow environment to gather error/warning information as required
 *       (transaction XML document, JTable, logging system, etc...)
 *   <li>Primiarly used as part of processing an Insert Element in the Transaction opperation of a
 *       Web Feature Server. (Allows us to fail a Feature without bothering the Database)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example Use (feature: id=1, name="foo", geom=linestring):
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * RangeFeatureValidation test = new RangeFeatureValidation();
 *
 * results.setValidation( test );
 * test.setMin(0);
 * test.validate( feature, featureType, results ); // true
 * test.setMin(2);
 * test.validate( feature, featureType, results ); // false
 * </code></pre>
