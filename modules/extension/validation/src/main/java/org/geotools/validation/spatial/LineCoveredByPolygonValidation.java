/**
 * Ensure a LineString is contained by Polygon.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is an integrity test in which we ensure that every LineString in a
 * FeatureType is contained by a Polygon in a second FeatureType. This needs
 * to be done as an Integrity Test to account for both the LineString and
 * Polygon FeatureTypes being changed in the same Transaction. Further more
 * the test will need to be run if either (or both) FeatureTypes are changed:
 * a new line may be created outside of a polygon, or a polygon may be deleted
 * leaving a line uncovered. If we a bit smarter about these relationship we
 * could run this Validation Test only on LineString insert/modify or Polygon
 * modify/delete but life is too short, and there is always another release.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To do this with any sense of efficiency we will need to take an initial run
 * through the Polygon SimpleFeatureSource to build an Index of FeatureID by
 * BoundingBox. We can use this to selectively query the Polygon FeatureSource
 * as we work through the LineString content.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO: David Zweirs Read This! Talk to Justin or any of the JUMP experts who
 * have experence in implementing JTS indexes. You can use the "layers" Map to
 * store the generated index, or make up an API to do so as part of the
 * ValidationProcessor. At the very least your index will last for the current
 * validation "run" - which is all that can be expected. What really needs to
 * be done is punt the index generation off to the database/DataStore anything
 * else won't scale (don't you love GIS problems).
