/**
 * A strategy for parsing components in an instance document which are of simple type.
 *
 * <p>Simple types can be manifested in elements and in attributes. Simple type strategies must be
 * capable of parsing simple values regardless of the form.
 *
 * <p>Strategy objects must declare how they relate to other strategy objects in the type hierarchy
 * of the type they parse. To allow strategy objects which relate through a type hiearchy to
 * communicate, a value is passed along to strategies as they are executed. As an example, consider
 * the strategies for <b>integer</b> and <b>decimal</b>.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * class DecimalStrategy implements Strategy {
 *                 ...
 *
 *                 int getExecutionMode() {
 *                         return OVERRIDE;
 *                 }
 *
 *                 Object parse(InstanceComponent instance, Object value)
 *                         throws Exception {
 *
 *                         BigDecimal decimal = new BigDecimal(instance.getText());
 *                         return decimal;
 *                 }
 *                 ...
 *         }
 *
 * class IntegerStrategy implements Strategy {
 *         ...
 *         int getExecutionMode() {
 *                 return AFTER;
 *         }
 *
 *         Object parse(InstanceComponent instance, Object value)
 *                 throws Exception {
 *
 *                 BigDecimal decimal = (BigDecimal)value;
 *                 return decimal.toBigInteger();
 *         }
 *         ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, the decimal strategy is at the top of the hierarchy as it declares its
 * execution mode as {@link Binding#OVERRIDE}. Therefore it must process the raw text of the
 * instance being parsed, and transform it into the specific object, in this case an object of type
 * BigDecimal.
 *
 * <p>The integer strategy extends the decimal strategy as it declares its execution mode as {@link
 * Binding#AFTER}. Therefore the integer strategy has access to the result of the decimal strategy,
 * and can simply transform the result of the decimal strategy into its specific type. In this case
 * an object of type BigInteger.
