/**
 * Provides the ability to write Features information.
 *
 * <p>
 * Capabilities:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Similar API to FeatureReader
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * After aquiring a feature using next() you may call remove() or after
 * modification write().  If you do not call one of these two methods before
 * calling hasNext(), or next() for that matter, the feature will be left
 * unmodified.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * This API allows modification, and Filter based modification to be written.
 * Please see AbstractDataStore for examples of implementing common
 * opperations using this API.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * In order to add new Features, FeatureWriters capable of accepting new
 * content allow next() to be called when hasNext() is <code>false</code> to
 * allow new feature creation. These changes
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * One thing that is really nice about the approach to adding content is that
 * the generation of FID is not left in the users control.
