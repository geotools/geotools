/**
 * The controller for Transaction with FeatureStore.
 *
 * <p>
 * Shapefiles, databases, etc. are safely modified with the assistance of this
 * interface. Transactions are also to provide authorization when working with
 * locked features.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All operations are considered to be working against a Transaction.
 * Transaction.AUTO_COMMIT is used to represent an immidiate mode where
 * requests are immidately commited.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For more information please see DataStore and FeatureStore.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example Use:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * Transaction t = new DefaultTransaction("handle");
 * t.putProperty( "hint", new Integer(7) );
 * try {
 *     SimpleFeatureStore road = (SimpleFeatureStore) store.getFeatureSource("road");
 *     FeatureStore river = (SimpleFeatureStore) store.getFeatureSource("river");
 *
 *     road.setTransaction( t );
 *     river.setTransaction( t );
 *
 *     t.addAuthorization( lockID );  // provide authoriztion
 *     road.removeFeatures( filter ); // operate against transaction
 *     river.removeFeature( filter ); // operate against transaction
 *
 *     t.commit(); // commit operations
 * }
 * catch (IOException io){
 *     t.rollback(); // cancel operations
 * }
 * finally {
 *     t.close(); // free resources
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Example code walkthrough (from the perspective of Transaction):
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>A new transaction is created (an instanceof DefaultTransaction with a handle)</li>
 * <li>A hint is provided using Transaction.putProperty( key, value )</li>
 * <li>Transaction is provided to two FeatureStores, this may result
 *     in Transaction.State instances being registered</li>
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>DiffTransactionState (stored by DataStore):
 *         Used for in memory locking by many DataStore's
 *         (like ShapefileDataStore).
 *         Lazy creation as part of ContentDataStore.getFeatureSource(Name typeName, Transaction tx).
 *         </li>
 *     <li>JDBCTransactionState (stored by ConnectionPool):
 *         Used to manage connection rollback/commit.
 *         Lazy creation as part of JDBCDataStore.getConnection(transaction).
 *         </li>
 *     <li>InProcessLockingManager.FeatureLock (stored by LockingManger):
 *         Used for per transaction FeatureLocks, used to free locked features
 *         on Transaction commit/rollback.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     These instances of Transaction state may make use of any hint provided
 *     to Transaction.putProperty( key, value ) when they are connected with
 *     Transaction.State.setTransaction( transaction ).
 * <li>t.addAuthorization(lockID) is called, each Transaction.State has its
 *     addAuthroization(String) callback invoked with the value of lockID</li>
 * <li>FeatureStore.removeFeatures methods are called on the two DataStores.
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>PostgisFeatureStore.removeFeatures(fitler) handles operation
 *         without delegation.
 *         </li>
 *     <li>Most removeFeature(filter) implementations use the implementation
 *         provided by ContentFeatureStore which delegates to FeatureWriter.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     Any of these operations may make use of the
 *     Transaction.putProperty( key, value ).
 * <li>The transaction is commited, all of the Transaction.State methods have
 *     there Transaction.State.commit() methods called gicing them a chance
 *     to applyDiff maps, or commit various connections.
 *     </li>
 * <li>The transaction is closed, all of the Transaction.State methods have
 *     there Transaction.State.setTransaction( null ) called, giving them a
 *     chance to clean up diffMaps, or return connections to the pool.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
