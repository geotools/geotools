/**
 * Access to "simple" Feature content where each feature has the same SimpleFeatureType.
 *
 * <p>Please keep in mind that a SimpleFeatureCollection is similar to a result set; and may not
 * necessarily load everything in to memory. Treat each iterator as a forward only cursor in the
 * JDBC sense; and take care to FeatureIterator.close() after use.
 *
 * <h3>SimpleFeatureIterator close</h3>
 *
 * <p>SimpleFeatureCollection provides streaming access with the following restrictions on use of
 * {@link SimpleFeatureIterator}: You must call {@link SimpleFeatureIterator#close()}. This allows
 * FeatureCollection to clean up any operating system resources used to access information.
 *
 * <p>Example (safe) use:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * SimpleFeatureIterator iterator = simpleFeatureCollection.features();
 * try {
 *     while( iterator.hasNext() ){
 *          SimpleFeature feature = iterator.next();
 *          System.out.println( feature.getID() );
 *     }
 * }
 * finally {
 *     iterator.close();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * And in Java 7:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * try ( SimpleFeatureIterator iterator = simpleFeatureCollection.features() ){
 *     while( iterator.hasNext() ){
 *          SimpleFeature feature = iterator.next();
 *          System.out.println( feature.getID() );
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>

     * <p>The implementation of FeatureIterator must adhere to the rules of fail-fast concurrent
     * modification. In addition (to allow for resource backed collections) the <code>
     * SimpleFeatureIterator.close()</code> method must be called.
