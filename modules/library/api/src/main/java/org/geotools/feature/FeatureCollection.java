/**
 * Collection of features, often handled as a result set.
 *
 * <p>Where possible FeatureCollection is method compatible with {@link Collection}.
 *
 * <p>SimpleFeatureCollection house rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each iterator is considered a live connection which must be closed (see example below)
 *   <li>Features are not specifically ordered within the SimpleFeatureCollection
 *   <li>Two Feature instances cannot exist with the same {@link FeatureId}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3>FeatureIterator close</h3>
 *
 * <p>FeatureCollection provides streaming access with the following restriction on the use of
 * {@link FeatureIterator}: You must call {@link FeatureIterator#close()}. This allows
 * FeatureCollection to clean up any operating system resources used to access information.
 *
 * <p>Example (safe) use:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * FeatureIterator iterator = featureCollection.features();
 * try {
 *     while( iterator.hasNext() ){
 *          Feature feature = iterator.next();
 *          System.out.println( feature.getID() );
 *     }
 * }
 * finally {
 *     iterator.close();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * And in Java 7:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * try ( FeatureIterator iterator = featureCollection.features() ){
 *     while( iterator.hasNext() ){
 *          Feature feature = iterator.next();
 *          System.out.println( feature.getID() );
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Handy Tip: Although many resource backed collections will choose to release resources at when
 * the iterator has reached the end of its contents this is not something you should rely on.
 *
 * <h2>FeatureCollection Implementation Tips</h2>
 *
 * <p>Auto close: Try and close up resources when you can detect that an Iterator is no longer in
 * use.
 *
 * <p>Lazy Connect: FeatureCollection is used in two fashions, as a result set, where each iterator
 * acts as a cursor over the content. Also as a predefined query which can be refined further. An
 * example is using featureCollection.subCollection( Filter ) or featureCollection.sort( SortBy )
 * before listing features out of a FeatureCollection.
