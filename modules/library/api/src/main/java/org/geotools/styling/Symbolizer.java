/**
 * This is the parent interface of all Symbolizers.
 *
 * <p>A symbolizer describes how a feature should appear on a map. The symbolizer describes not just
 * the shape that should appear but also such graphical properties as color and opacity.
 *
 * <p>A symbolizer is obtained by specifying one of a small number of different types of symbolizer
 * and then supplying parameters to overide its default behaviour.
 *
 * <p>The details of this object are taken from the <a
 * href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=1188">OGC Styled-Layer Descriptor
 * Report (OGC 02-070) version 1.0.0.</a>
 *
 * <p>Renderers can use this information when displaying styled features, though it must be
 * remembered that not all renderers will be able to fully represent strokes as set out by this
 * interface. For example, opacity may not be supported.
 *
 * <p>The graphical parameters and their values are derived from SVG/CSS2 standards with names and
 * semantics which are as close as possible.
