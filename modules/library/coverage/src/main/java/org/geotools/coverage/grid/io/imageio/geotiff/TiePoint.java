/**
 * Quoting the geotiff spec:
 *
 * <pre>
 *      ModelTiepointTag:
 *      Tag = 33922 (8482.H)
 *      Type = DOUBLE (IEEE Double precision)
 *      N = 6*K,  K = number of tiepoints
 *      Alias: GeoreferenceTag
 *      Owner: Intergraph
 * </pre>
 *
 * This tag stores raster->model tiepoint pairs in the order
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ModelTiepointTag = (...,I,J,K, X,Y,Z...),
 * </pre>
 *
 * where (I,J,K) is the point at location (I,J) in raster space with pixel-value K, and (X,Y,Z) is a
 * vector in model space. In most cases the model space is only two-dimensional, in which case both
 * K and Z should be set to zero; this third dimension is provided in anticipation of future support
 * for 3D digital elevation models and vertical coordinate systems.
 *
 * <p>A raster image may be georeferenced simply by specifying its location, size and orientation in
 * the model coordinate space M. This may be done by specifying the location of three of the four
 * bounding corner points. However, tiepoints are only to be considered exact at the points
 * specified; thus defining such a set of bounding tiepoints does not imply that the model space
 * locations of the interior of the image may be exactly computed by a linear interpolation of these
 * tiepoints.
 *
 * <p>However, since the relationship between the Raster space and the model space will often be an
 * exact, affine transformation, this relationship can be defined using one set of tiepoints and the
 * "ModelPixelScaleTag", described below, which gives the vertical and horizontal raster grid cell
 * size, specified in model units.
 *
 * <p>If possible, the first tiepoint placed in this tag shall be the one establishing the location
 * of the point (0,0) in raster space. However, if this is not possible (for example, if (0,0) is
 * goes to a part of model space in which the projection is ill-defined), then there is no
 * particular order in which the tiepoints need be listed.
 *
 * <p>For orthorectification or mosaicking applications a large number of tiepoints may be specified
 * on a mesh over the raster image. However, the definition of associated grid interpolation methods
 * is not in the scope of the current GeoTIFF spec.
