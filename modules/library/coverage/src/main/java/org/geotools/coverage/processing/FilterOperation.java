/**
 * Common super-class for filter operation. The following is adapted from OpenGIS specification:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * Filtering is an enhancement operation that alters the grid values on the basis of the
 * neighborhood grid values. For this reason, filtering is considered to be a spatial or
 * area operation. There are many different filters that can be applied to a grid coverage
 * but the general concept of filtering is the same. A filter window or kernel is defined,
 * its dimension being an odd number in the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> dimensions. Each
 * cell in this window contains a co-efficient or weighting factor representative of some
 * mathematical relationship. A filtered grid coverage is generated by multiplying each
 * coefficient in the window by the grid value in the original grid coverage corresponding
 * to the windows current location and assigning the result to the central pixel location
 * of the window in the filtered grid coverage. The window is moved throughout the grid coverage
 * on pixel at a time. This window multiplication process is known as convolution. A grid coverage
 * contains both low and high spatial information. High frequencies describe rapid change from one
 * grid cell to another such as roads or other boundary conditions. Low frequencies describe gradual
 * change over a large number of cells such as water bodies. High pass filters allow only high
 * frequency information to be generated in the new grid coverage Grid coverages generated with high
 * pass filters will show edge conditions. Low pass filters allow low frequency information
 * to be generated in the new grid coverage. The grid coverage produced from a filtering
 * operation will have the same dimension as the source grid coverage. To produce filtered
 * values around the edges of the source grid coverage, edge rows and columns will be
 * duplicated to fill a complete kernel.
