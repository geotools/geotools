/**
 * Common super-class for filter operation. The following is adapted from OpenGIS specification:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * Filtering is an enhancement operation that alters the grid values on the basis of the
 * neighborhood grid values. For this reason, filtering is considered to be a spatial or area
 * operation. There are many different filters that can be applied to a grid coverage but the
 * general concept of filtering is the same. A filter window or kernel is defined, its dimension
 * being an odd number in the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> dimensions. Each cell in this window
 * contains a co-efficient or weighting factor representative of some mathematical relationship. A
 * filtered grid coverage is generated by multiplying each coefficient in the window by the grid
 * value in the original grid coverage corresponding to the windowÂ’s current location and assigning
 * the result to the central pixel location of the window in the filtered grid coverage. The window
 * is moved throughout the grid coverage on pixel at a time. This window multiplication process is
 * known as convolution. A grid coverage contains both low and high spatial information. High
 * frequencies describe rapid change from one grid cell to another such as roads or other boundary
 * conditions. Low frequencies describe gradual change over a large number of cells such as water
 * bodies. High pass filters allow only high frequency information to be generated in the new grid
 * coverage Grid coverages generated with high pass filters will show edge conditions. Low pass
 * filters allow low frequency information to be generated in the new grid coverage. The grid
 * coverage produced from a filtering operation will have the same dimension as the source grid
 * coverage. To produce filtered values around the edges of the source grid coverage, edge rows and
 * columns will be duplicated to fill a complete kernel.
