/**
 * Defines the DataStore API via which all data is imported or exported.
 *
 * <p>All DataStores (e.g. PostGIS, Shapefile(tm), GML...) must provide implementations of the
 * DataStore interface and the DataStoreFactorySpi interface. These interfaces allow new types of
 * datastore to be plugged into applications which use GeoTools without the need to modify any code.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * FeatureStore postgis = new PostGisDataStore( ... );
 * Query all = Query.ALL;
 * FeatureType roadType = postgis.getFeatureType( "roads" );
 *
 * // reader 1 streams over all roads
 * FeatureReader reader1 = postgis.getFeatureReader( roadsType, all, Transaction.AUTO_COMMIT );
 *
 * // allRoads = featureResults is a prepaired query of all roads
 * FeatureSource roads = postgis.getFeatureSource( "roads" );
 * FeatureResults allRoads = roads.getFeatures( all );
 *
 * // reader 2 & 3 streams over all roads in the same manner as reader 1
 * FeatureReader reader2 = allRoads.reader();
 * FeatureReader reader3 = allRoads.reader();
 *
 * // bounds1 returns the bounding box of roads, may be null depending on expense
 * Envelope bounds1 = roads.getBounds( all );
 *
 * // bounds2 returns the bounding box of roads, may actually calculate by going over the entire dataset
 * Envelope bounds 2 = allRoads.getBounds();
 * </code></pre>
