/**
 * This class provides a high-level API for operations on feature data. Typically, when working with
 * a data source such as a shapefile or database table you will initially create a {@code DataStore}
 * object to connect to the physical source and then retrieve a {@code FeatureSource} to work with
 * the feature data, as in this excerpt from the GeoTools Quickstart example (<a
 * href="http://geotools.org/quickstart.html">http://geotools.org/quickstart.html</a>)
 *
 * <pre><code>

 *     FeatureSource featureSource = store.getFeatureSource();
