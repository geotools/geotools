/**
 * Basic support for a FeatureReader<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature> that does filtering. I think
 * that filtering should perhaps be done in the AttributeReader. I'm still having a bit of trouble
 * with the split between attributeReader and featureReader as to where the hooks for advanced
 * processing like filtering should take place. See my note on hasNext(), as the method is currently
 * broken and there are more optimizations that could take place if we had a
 * FilteringAttributeReader. So this class may go, but I thought I'd put the ideas into code.
 *
 * <p>Jody here - changed hasNext() to peek as required.
