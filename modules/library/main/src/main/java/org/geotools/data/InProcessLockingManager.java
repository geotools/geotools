 * @task REVISIT: I'm not sure that the map within a map is a good idea, it makes things perhaps too
 *     complicated. A nasty bug came about with releasing, as allLocks put locks into a new
 *     collection, and the iterator just removed them from that set instead of from the storage.
 *     This is now fixed, but the loop to do it is really damn complex. I'm not sure of the
 *     solution, but there should be something that is less confusing.
