/**
 * Provides support for the Open Web Service Specificaitons.
 *
 * <p>This class operates as a Factory creating request for Open Web Services.
 *
 * <p>The idea is that this class operates a Toolkit for all things assocated with an Open Web
 * Service specification. The various objects produced by this toolkit are used as strategy objects
 * for the top level AbstractOpenWebService subclass. Example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WebMapServer - uses a GetCapabilitiesRequest during version negotiation.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both name and version information that may be checked against a GetCapabilities document
 * during version negotiation. Specific Open Web Service implementations can extend this interface
 * to include details that are specific to their specification. Example: The Web Map Service
 * specification includes more operations such as GetMap and GetFeatureInfo.
 *
 * <p><b>Q:</b> Why are these not static?<br>
 * <b>A:</b> Because we want to place new specifications into a data structure for WebMapServer to
 * search through dynamically
