/**
 * This iterator is used to indicate that contents could not be aquired.
 *
 * <p>The normal Collection.iterator() method does not let us return an error (we always have to
 * return an iterator). However Iterator.next() can be used to return an NoSuchElementException.
 *
 * <p>So we are basically going to lie, we are going to pretend their is content *once*, and when
 * they ask for it we are going to hit them with a NoSuchElementExcetion. This is a mean trick, but
 * it does convey the idea of asking for content that is supposed to be there and failing to aquire
 * it.
