/**
 * An interface for the construction of Features.

 * the FeatureType itself, thus the FeatureType interface extends this interface. Other
 * FeatureFactories may be implemented, but they should probably be constructed with a FeatureType.
 *
 * <p>Geotools 2.1: This class is under revision, pleae help out with feedback. Please see
 * experimental FeatureFactory2 (a subclass) for the current best idea of what is needed.

 * @task REVISIT: consider a static create(Object[] attributes, String FeatureID, FeatureType type)
 *     method.
 * @task REVISIT: move these methods directly to FeatureType? This would not allow independent
 *     FeatureFactories, but I'm not sure if those are useful at all.
