/**
 * Provides an implementation of Iterator that will filter
 * contents using the provided filter.
 * <p>
 * This is a *Generic* iterator not limited to Feature, this
 * will become more interesting as Filter is able to evaulate
 * itself with more things then just Features.
 * </p>

 * This also explains the use of Collection (where you may
 * have expected a FeatureCollection). However
 * <code>FeatureCollectoin.close( iterator )</code> will be
 * called on the internal delgate.
