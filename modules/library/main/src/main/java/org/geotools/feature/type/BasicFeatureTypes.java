/**
 * Defines required attributes for Annotations.
 *
 * <p>Annotations represent a text based geographic feature. The geometry stored in the feature
 * indicates where the text should be drawn and the attribute indicated by the {@link
 * #ANNOTATION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME} attribute holds the text to be displayed for the feature.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   if ( feature.getFeatureType().isDescendedFrom( AnnotationFeatureType.ANNOTATION ) )
 *   {
 *     String attributeName = (String)feature.getAttribute( AnnotationFeatureType.ANNOTATION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME );
 *     String annotationText = (String)feature.getAttribute( attributeName );
 *     ... // Do something with the annotation text and feature
 *   }
 * </pre>
