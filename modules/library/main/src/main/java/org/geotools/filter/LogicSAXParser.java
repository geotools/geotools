/**
 * Processes messages from clients to create Logic Filters. Handles nested logic filters. Filters
 * should call start and end when they reach logic filters, and create when the filter is complete.
 *
 * <p>This documenation provided by Dave Blasby April 1/2005 after fixing GEOS-328: DJB: okay,
 * there's no where near enough comments in here to understand whats going on. Hopefully I'm
 * correct. I've looked at this for a bit, and this is what I can figure out.
 *
 * <p>This is called by the FilterFilter class (nice name...NOT) which is also a sax parser-like
 * class. Basically, the FilterFilter does most of the Filter parsing - but it hands most of the
 * work off to the appropriate classes. For NOT, AND, OR clauses, this class is used.
 *
 * <p>As a simple example, <filter> <OR> [STATE_NAME = 'NY'] [STATE_NAME = 'WA'] </OR></FILTER> Or,
 * in long form: <Filter> <Or> <PropertyIsEqualTo> <PropertyName>STATE_NAME</PropertyName>
 * <Literal>NY</Literal> </PropertyIsEqualTo> <PropertyIsEqualTo>
 * <PropertyName>STATE_NAME</PropertyName> <Literal>WA</Literal> </PropertyIsEqualTo> </Or>
 * </Filter>
 *
 * <p>The "PropertyIsEqualTo" is handled by another parser, so we dont have to worry about it here
 * for the moment.
 *
 * <p>So, the order of events are like this:
 *
 * <p>start( "OR" ) add([STATE_NAME = 'NY']) // these are handled by another class add([STATE_NAME =
 * 'WA']) // these are handled by another class end ("OR") create() // this creates an actual Filter
 * [[ STATE_NAME = NY ] OR [ STATE_NAME = WA ]]
 *
 * <p>This is pretty simple, but it gets more complex when you have nested structures.
 *
 * <p><Filter> <And> <Or> <PropertyIsEqualTo> <PropertyName>STATE_NAME</PropertyName>
 * <Literal>NY</Literal> </PropertyIsEqualTo> <PropertyIsEqualTo>
 * <PropertyName>STATE_NAME</PropertyName> <Literal>WA</Literal> </PropertyIsEqualTo> </Or>
 * <PropertyIsEqualTo> <PropertyName>STATE_NAME</PropertyName> <Literal>BC</Literal>
 * </PropertyIsEqualTo> </And> </Filter>
 *
 * <p>Again, we're going to ignore the "PropertyIsEqualTo" stuff since its handled elsewhere.
 *
 * <p>The main idea is that there will be a LogicSAXParser for the top-level "AND" and another one
 * for the nested "OR". It gets a bit harder to describe because the classes start passing events to
 * each other.
 *
 * <p>start("AND") -- the parent LogicSAXParser starts to construct an "AND" filter start("OR") --
 * the "AND" parser sees that its sub-element is another logic operator. It makes another
 * LogicSAXParser that will handle the "OR" SAX events. add([STATE_NAME = 'NY']) -- this is sent to
 * the "AND" parser. It then sends it to the "OR" parser. + "OR" parser remembers this component
 * add([STATE_NAME = 'WA']) -- this is sent to the "AND" parser. It then sends it to the "OR"
 * parser. + "OR" parser remembers this component end("OR") -- this is sent to the "AND" parser. It
 * then sends it to the "OR" parser. + The "OR" parser marks itself as complete + The "AND" parser
 * notices that its child is completed parsing + The "AND" parser calls create() on the "OR" parser
 * to make a filter (see next step) + Since "OR" is finished, "AND" stop passing events to it.
 * "OR".create() -- makes a "[[ STATE_NAME = NY ] OR [ STATE_NAME = WA ]]" and "AND" remembers it as
 * a component add ([ STATE_NAME = BC ]) --This is added as a component to the "AND" filter. end
 * ("AND") -- the "AND" parser marks itself as complete create() -- the "AND" parser creates a
 * FILTER [[[ STATE_NAME = NY ] OR [ STATE_NAME = WA ]] AND [ STATE_NAME = BC ]]
 *
 * <p>Higher levels of nesting work the same way - each level will send the event down to the next
 * level.
 *
 * <p>If logicFilter == null then this object is the one doing the processing. If its non-null, then
 * the sub-object is doing the processing - event are sent to it.
