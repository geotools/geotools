/**
 * A rule is used to attach a condition to, and group, the individual symbolizers used for
 * rendering. The Title and Abstract describe the rule and may be used to generate a legend, as may
 * the LegendGraphic. The Filter, ElseFilter, MinScale and MaxScale elements allow the selection of
 * features and rendering scales for a rule. The scale selection works as follows. When a map is to
 * be rendered, the scale denominator is computed and all rules in all UserStyles that have a scale
 * outside of the request range are dropped. (This also includes Rules that have an ElseFilter.) An
 * ElseFilter is simply an ELSE condition to the conditions (Filters) of all other rules in the same
 * UserStyle. The exact meaning of the ElseFilter is determined after Rules have been eliminated for
 * not fitting the rendering scale. This definition of the behaviour of ElseFilters may seem a
 * little strange, but it allows for scale-dependent and scale-independent ELSE conditions. For the
 * Filter, only SqlExpression is available for specification, but this is a hack and should be
 * replaced with Filter as defined in WFS. A missing Filter element means "always true". If a set of
 * Rules has no ElseFilters, then some features may not be rendered (which is presumably the desired
 * behavior). The Scales are actually scale denominators (as double floats), so "10e6" would be
 * interpreted as 1:10M. A missing MinScale means there is no lower bound to the scale-denominator
 * range (lim[x->0+](x)), and a missing MaxScale means there is no upper bound (infinity). 0.28mm
