/**
 * An interface for classes that want to perform operations on a Style hierarchy. It forms part of a
 * GoF Visitor Patern implementation. A call to style.accept(StyleVisitor) will result in a call to
 * one of the methods in this interface. The responsibility for traversing sub filters is intended
 * to lie with the visitor (this is unusual, but permited under the Visitor pattern). A typical use
 * would be to transcribe a style into a specific format, e.g. XML or SQL. Alternativly it may be to
 * extract specific information from the Style structure, for example a list of all fills.
