  STATUS as of June 2008: CLEAN

    * Presume we can appropriate James Macgill's original work and its
      (C) 2002, Center for Computational Geography.

    * Presume we can appropriate minor stuff from GeoAPI.

    * Presume we can appropriate minor text from OGC specs.



* org.geotools.data
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This code was revised for the GeoServer 1.2 release as part of GeoTools 2.0, 
  design documentation and research for this effort is available at 
  http://vwfs.refractions.net/. Additional Java 5 generalization work
  introduced for GeoTools 2.5 in the form of DataAccess superclass.


* org.geotools.data.collection
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added in GeoTools 2.2 time frame to support closable iterators, mostly used to 
  define additional javadocs.

    * ResourceCollection borrows an idea of a closable iterator from hibernate

    * Collections API contract referenced from java.util.


* org.geotools.data.event
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added in GeoTools 2.2, based on event notification used in uDig (LGPL) allowing 
  for a delta based events relative to a tree root.

    * Method names compatible with some Eclipse code that informed origional design 
      uDig event design


* org.geotools.feature.[collection|visitor]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added in GeoTools 2.0, based on OGC / ISO feature model.
  Revised for GeoTools 2.1 based on GML2 requirements.
  Updated in GeoTools 2.2 to support random access, sorting and aggregate 
  functions.


* org.geotools.filter.[expression]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added for GeoTools 2.0 as part of Vision for new York, based on OGC Filter 
  specification.
  Updated for 2.2 to agree with Filter 1.1 specification.
  Updated for 2.3 to agree/extend with GeoAPI interfaces (also Filter 1.1).


* org.geotools.styling
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added baed on SLD specification for GeoTools 2.0.
  Some constructs like RemoteOWS added for GeoTools 2.1.
  Updated to agree with SLD 1.0, added event notification, and made method 
  compatible with GeoAPI 2.0 (GPL Licience) for GeoTools 2.2.

    * method names from GeoAPI 2.0 GPL project, not viewd as serious (and these 
      interfaces will be retired shortly)

    * Origional styling code is "Geotools - OpenSource mapping toolkit (C) 2002, 
      Center for Computational Geography" with James Macgill as a contact.


* org.geotools.util
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Modules Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This module provides several coverage implementations, with a focus on 
  GridCoverages. This work was begun in GeoTools 2.0 (2001 at Institut de 
  Recherche pour le DÃ©veloppement), and was revised to work with OGC based 
  interfaces for GeoTools 2.1 (interfaces hosted by GeoAPI).

  Coverage work continues as the focus of a specific GridCoverage branch for 
  GeoTools 2.3. Planned work continues to work on n dimensional geometry based on 
  ISO based Coverage interfaces (once again hosted by GeoAPI).


* org.geotools.coverage
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Added for GeoTools 2.0, updated to OGC coverage interfaces were prototyped for 
  GeoTools 2.1 and relased to GeoAPI when ready.

    * AbstractCoverage: OGC specification credit: "This package contains 
      documentation from OpenGIS specifications. OpenGIS consortium's work is fully 
      acknowledged here."
