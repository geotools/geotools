/**
 * Skeletal implementation of factories. This base classe provides no {@code createFoo} methods,
 * (they must be provided by subclasses), but provides two convenience features:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An initially empty {@linkplain #hints map of hints} to be filled by subclasses
 *       constructors. They are the hints to be returned by {@link #getImplementationHints}.</li>
 *   <li>An automatic {@linkplain FactoryRegistry#setOrdering ordering} applied
 *       on the basis of subclasses-provided {@linkplain #priority} rank.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When more than one factory implementation is
 * {@linkplain FactoryRegistry#registerServiceProvider registered} for the same category (i.e. they
 * implement the same {@link Factory} sub-interface), the actual instance to be used is selected
 * according their {@linkplain FactoryRegistry#setOrdering ordering} and user-supplied
 * {@linkplain Hints hints}. Hints have precedence. If more than one factory matches the hints
 * (including the common case where the user doesn't provide any hint at all), then ordering
 * matter.
 * <p>
 * The ordering is unspecified for every pairs of factories with the same {@linkplain #priority}.
 * This implies that the ordering is unspecified between all factories created with the
 * {@linkplain #AbstractFactory() default constructor}, since they all have the same
 * {@linkplain #NORMAL_PRIORITY default priority} level.
 *
 * <h3>How hints are set</h3>
 * Hints are used for two purposes. The distinction is important because the set
 * of hints may not be identical in both cases:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Hints are used for creating new factories.</li>
 *   <li>Hints are used in order to check if an <em>existing</em> factory is suitable.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * {@code AbstractFactory} do <strong>not</strong> provides any facility for the first case.
 * Factories implementations shall inspect themselves all relevant hints supplied by the user,
 * and pass them to any dependencies. Do <strong>not</strong> use the {@link #hints} field for
 * that; use the hints provided by the user in the constructor. If all dependencies are created
 * at construction time (<cite>constructor injection</cite>), there is no need to keep user's hints
 * once the construction is finished.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #hints} field is for the second case only. Implementations shall copy in this
 * field only the user's hints that are know to be relevant to this factory. If a hint is
 * relevant but the user didn't specified any value, the hint key should be added to the
 * {@link #hints} map anyway with a {@code null} value. Only direct dependencies shall be put
 * in the {@link #hints} map. Indirect dependencies (i.e. hints used by other factories used
 * by this factory) will be inspected automatically by {@link FactoryRegistry} in a recursive way.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The lack of constructor expecting a {@link Map} argument is intentional.
 * This is in order to discourage blind-copy of all user-supplied hints to the {@link #hints} map.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example:</strong> Lets two factories, A and B. Factory A need an instance of Factory B.
 * Factory A can be implemented as below:
 *
 * <table border='1'>
 * <tr><th>Code</th><th>Observations</th></tr>
 * <tr><td><blockquote><pre>
 * class FactoryA extends AbstractFactory {
 *     FactoryB fb;
 *
 *     FactoryA(Hints userHints) {
 *         fb = FactoryFinder.getFactoryB(userHints);
 *         hints.put(Hints.FACTORY_B, fb);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote></td>
 * <td>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The user-supplied map ({@code userHints}) is never modified.</li>
 *   <li>All hints relevant to other factories are used in the constructor. Hints relevant to
 *       factory B are used when {@code FactoryFinder.getFactoryB(...)} is invoked.</li>
 *   <li>The {@code FactoryA} constructor stores only the hints relevant to {@code FactoryA}.
 *       Indirect dependencies (e.g. hints relevant to {@code FactoryB}) will be inspected
 *       recursively by {@link FactoryRegistry}.</li>
 *   <li>In the above example, {@link #hints} will never be used for creating new factories.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </td></tr></table>
