ADJUSTED_GRID_GEOMETRY_$1=Grid geometry has been adjusted for coverage "{0}".
AMBIGUOUS_ELLIPSOID=Ambiguity between inverse flattening and semi minor axis length. Using inverse flattening.
APPLIED_OPERATION_$4={3,choice,0#Apply|Reuse} operation "{1}" on coverage "{0}" with interpolation "{2}".

FALLBACK_FACTORY_$1=Failure in the primary factory: {0} Now trying the fallback factory...
FOUND_MISMATCHED_CRS_$4=Found {0} reference systems in {1} elements. The most frequent appears {2} time and the less frequent appears {3} times.
HINT_IGNORED_$1=Ignored "{0}" hint.
INITIALIZING_TRANSFORMATION_$2=Initializing transformation from {0} to {1}.
LOADED_JDBC_DRIVER_$3=Loaded "{0}" JDBC driver version {1}.{2}.
LOADING_DATUM_ALIASES_$1=Loading datum aliases from "{0}".
LOCALES_DISCARTED=Text were discarted for some locales.
MISMATCHED_COORDINATE_OPERATION_FACTORIES_$2=No coordinate operation from "{0}" to "{1}" because of mismatched factories.
MISMATCHED_URI_TYPE_$1=The type of the requested object doesn't match the "{0}" URI type.
NATIVE_ACCELERATION_STATE_$2=Native acceleration {1,choice,0#disabled|enabled} for "{0}" operation.

PAINTING_LAYER_$2=Renderer "{0}" painted in {1} seconds.
POLYGON_CACHE_USE_$4=Polygons drawn with {0,number,percent} of available points, reusing {1,number,percent} from the cache (resolution: {2} {3}).
RECOVERABLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY_$1=Failed to allocate {0} Mb of memory. Trying a smaller memory allocation.
REDIRECTED_TO_COMMONS_LOGGING=Log records are redirected to Apache commons logging.
REGISTERED_JAI_OPERATIONS=Registered Geotools extensions to JAI operations.
RESSAMPLING_RENDERED_IMAGE_$3=Select an image of "{0}" decimated to level {1} of {2}.
SAMPLE_TRANSCODE_$3=Creates a {1,choice,0#packed|1#geophysics|2#photographic} view of grid coverage "{0}" using operation "{2}".
SEND_REPAINT_EVENT_$1=Layer "{0}" send a repaint event for the whole widget area.
SEND_REPAINT_EVENT_$5=Layer "{0}" send a repaint event for pixels x\=[{1}..{2}] and y\=[{3}..{4}] in widget area.
UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION=Attempt to recover from unexpected exception.
UNEXPECTED_UNIT_$1=Unexpected unit "{0}". Map scale may be inacurate.
UNKNOW_PARAMETER_$3=Ignoring unknow parameter: "{0}" = {1} {2}.
UNKNOW_STYLE_$2=Can't handle style of class {0}. Consequently, geometry "{1}" will ignore its style information.
