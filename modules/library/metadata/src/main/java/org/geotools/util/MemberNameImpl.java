/**
 * The name to identify a member of a {@linkplain org.opengis.util.Record record}. This is typically
 * used as of a <code>Map<{@linkplain MemberName},{@linkplain TypeName}></code>.
 *
 * <p>It may be more simple to think of {@code MemberName} <em>as</em> a {@link java.util.Map.Entry}
 * - since it is both the "key" and the "value".
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>key: {@code this}
 *   <li>value: associated {@link TypeName}
 * </ul>
 *
 * This presents a bit of a conflict in that we are never quite sure what comes first the record or
 * the member during creation time.
