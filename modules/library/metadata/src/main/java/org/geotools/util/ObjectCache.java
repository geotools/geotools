/**
 * A cache for arbitrary objects. Cache implementations are thread-safe and support concurrency. A
 * cache entry can be locked when an object is in process of being created, but the locking /
 * unlocking <strong>must</strong> be protected in a {@code try} ... {@code finally} block.
 *
 * <p>To use as a reader:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * key = &quot;EPSG:4326&quot;;
 * CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = cache.get(key);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * To overwrite:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * cache.put(key, crs);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * To reserve the entry while figuring out what to write:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *     cache.writeLock(key); // may block if another writer is working on this code.
 *     value = cache.peek(key);
 *     if (value == null) {
 *        // another writer got here first
 *     } else {
 *        value = figuringOutWhatToWrite(....);
 *        cache.put(key, value);
 *     }
 * } finally {
 *     cache.writeUnLock(key);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * To use as a proper cache:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * CylindricalCS cs = (CylindricalCS) cache.get(key);
 * if (cs == null) {
 *     try {
 *         cache.writeLock(key);
 *         cs = (CylindricalCS) cache.test(key);
 *         if (cs == null) {
 *             cs = csAuthority.createCylindricalCS(code);
 *             cache.put(key, cs);
 *         }
 *     } finally {
 *         cache.writeUnLock(key);
 *     }
 * }
 * return cs;
 * </pre>
