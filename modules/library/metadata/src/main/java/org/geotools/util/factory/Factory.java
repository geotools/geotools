/**
 * Base interface for Geotools factories (i.e. service discovery).
 *
 * <p>This interfaces forms the core of the Geotools plug-in system, by which capabilities can be
 * added to the library at runtime. Each sub-interface defines a <cite>service</cite>. Most services
 * are set up with concrete implementation being registered for use in a <cite>service
 * registry</cite>, which acts as a container for service implementations.
 *
 * <p>Service registries don't need to be a Geotools implementation. They can be (but are not
 * limited to) any {@link javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry} subclass. If the standard {@code
 * ServiceRegistry} (or its Geotools extension {@link FactoryRegistry}) is selected as a container
 * for services, then factory implementations should be declared as below (select only one way):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Register for automatic discovery</strong>
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Provide a public no-arguments constructor.
 *         <li>Add the fully qualified name of the <u>implementation</u> class in the {@code
 *             META-INF/services/}<var>classname</var> file where <var>classname</var> is the fully
 *             qualified name of the service <u>interface</u>.
 *         <li>The factory implementations will be discovered when {@link
 *             FactoryRegistry#scanForPlugins} will be invoked.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li><strong><u>Or</u> register explicitly by application code</strong>
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Invoke {@link ServiceRegistry#registerServiceProvider} in application code.
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, it is recommended that implementations provide a constructor expecting a single
 * {@link Hints} argument. This optional argument gives to the user some control of the factory's
 * low-level details. The amount of control is factory specific. The geotools library defines a
 * global class called {@link Hints} that is ment as API (i.e. you can assume these hints are
 * supported). Factories may also provide information on their own custom hints as part of their
 * javadoc class description. <strong>Examples:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       <p>An application supplied a {@linkplain Hints#DATUM_FACTORY datum factory hint}, being
 *       passed to a {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.DatumAuthorityFactory datum authority
 *       factory} so that all datum created from an authority code will come from the supplied datum
 *       factory.
 *   <li>
 *       <p>An application supplied a {@link org.geotools.feature.FeatureFactory} (ensuring all
 *       constructed features support the Eclipse's {@code IAdaptable} interface), being passed to a
 *       {@link org.geotools.feature.FeatureTypeFactory} so that all {@code FeatureTypes}
 *       constructed will produce features supporting the indicated interface.
 *       <p>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>As seen in those examples this concept of a hint becomes more interesting when the operation
 * being controlled is discovery of other services used by the Factory. By supplying appropriate
 * hints one can chain together several factories and retarget them to an application specific task.

public interface Factory {
    /**
     * Map of hints (maybe {@linkplain java.util.Collections#unmodifiableMap unmodifiable}) used by
     * this factory to customize its use. This map is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to contains
     * all the hints supplied by the user; it may be only a subset. Consequently, hints provided
     * here are usually not suitable for creating new factories, unless the implementation make some
     * additional garantees.
     *
     * <p>The primary purpose of this method is to determine if an <strong>existing</strong> factory
     * instance can be reused for a set of user-supplied hints. This method is invoked by {@link
     * FactoryRegistry} in order to compare this factory's hints against user's hints. This is
     * dependency introspection only; {@code FactoryRegistry} <strong>never</strong> invokes this
     * method for creating new factories.
     *
     * <p>Keys are usually static constants from the {@link Hints} class, while values are instances
     * of some key-dependent class. The {@linkplain Map#keySet key set} must contains at least all
     * hints impacting functionality. While the key set may contains all hints supplied by the user,
     * it is recommended to limit the set to only the hints used by this particular factory
     * instance. A minimal set will helps {@link FactoryRegistry} to compare only hints that matter
     * and avoid the creation of unnecessary instances of this factory.
     *
     * <p>The hint values may be different than the one supplied by the user. If a user supplied a
     * hint as a {@link Class} object, this method shall replace it by the actual instance used, if
     * possible.
     *
     * <p>Implementations of this method are usually quite simple. For example if a {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.referencing.datum.DatumAuthorityFactory datum authority factory} uses an ordinary
     * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.DatumFactory datum factory}, its method could be
     * implemented as below (note that we should not check if the datum factory is null, since key
     * with null value is the expected behaviour in this case). Example:
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * Map hints = new HashMap();
     * hints.put({@linkplain Hints#DATUM_FACTORY}, datumFactory);
     * return hints;
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * @return The map of hints, or an {@linkplain java.util.Collections#EMPTY_MAP empty map} if
     *     none.
