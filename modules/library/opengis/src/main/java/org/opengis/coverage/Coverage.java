/**
 * A function from a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain to an attribute range. A coverage
 * associates a {@linkplain DirectPosition position} within its domain to a record of values of
 * defined data types. Examples include a raster image, polygon overlay, or digital elevation
 * matrix. The essential property of coverage is to be able to generate a value for any point within
 * its domain. How coverage is represented internally is not a concern.
 *
 * <p>For example consider the following different internal representations of coverage:<br>
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <li>A coverage may be represented by a set of polygons which exhaustively tile a plane (that is
 *       each point on the plane falls in precisely one polygon). The value returned by the coverage
 *       for a point is the value of an attribute of the polygon that contains the point.
 *   <li>A coverage may be represented by a grid of values (a {@linkplain DiscreteGridPointCoverage
 *       Discrete Grid Point Coverage}). If the coverage is a {@linkplain
 *       ContinuousQuadrilateralGridCoverage Continuous Quadrilateral Grid Coverage} using
 *       {@linkplain InterpolationMethod#NEAREST_NEIGHBOUR Nearest Neighbour} interpolation method,
 *       then the value returned by the coverage for a point is that of the grid value whose
 *       location is nearest the point.
 *   <li>Coverage may be represented by a mathematical function. The value returned by the coverage
 *       for a point is just the return value of the function when supplied the coordinates of the
 *       point as arguments.
 *   <li>Coverage may be represented by combination of these. For example, coverage may be
 *       represented by a combination of mathematical functions valid over a set of polynomials.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <h3>Metadata</h3>
 *
 * The legacy {@linkplain Specification#OGC_01004 OGC 01-004} specification provided some methods
 * for fetching metadata values attached to a coverage. The {@linkplain Specification#ISO_19123 ISO
 * 19123} specification do not provides such methods. Implementations that want to provide such
 * metadata are encouraged to implement the {@link javax.media.jai.PropertySource} or {@link
 * javax.media.jai.WritablePropertySource} interface.
