/**
 * Defines a constraint that can be checked against an instance of an object (Usually a Feature).
 *
 * <p?
 * This is an abstract super type of the Filters defined by the Filter specification; you are not
 * free to define your own filters. For extensibility please explore the definition of
 * your own {@link Function}.
 * <p>Often
 * a filter is used to to define a set {@linkplain Feature feature} instances that are to be
 * operated upon. The operating set can be comprised of one or more enumerated features or a set of
 * features defined by specifying spatial and non-spatial constraints on the geometric and scalar
 * properties of a feature type.
 *
 * <p>Roughly speaking, a filter encodes the information present in the {@code WHERE} clause of a
 * SQL statement. There are various subclasses of this class that implement many types of filters,
 * such as simple property comparisons or spatial queries.
 *
 * <p>The second use of Filter focuses on expressing constraints (or Facets). This use places
 * restrictions on the allowable and is captured as part of schema information (@linkplain
 * FeatureType). This is similar to the XML concept of "facets".
