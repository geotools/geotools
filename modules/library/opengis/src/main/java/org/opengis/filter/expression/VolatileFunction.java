/**
 * Marker interface indicating that that the function return value can change during a single data
 * access operation even if the argument values provided to it remain constant
 *
 * <p>Very few functions are truly volatile, one example being random(), whose value is going to
 * change over each invocation, even during the same feature collection filtering
 *
 * <p>Functions whose value changes over time but not within the same feature collection filtering
 * are considered to be <em>stable</em> and as such their result can be considered a constant during
 * the single data access operation
 *
 * <p>GeoTools will try to optimize out the stable functions and replace them with a constant that
 * can be easily encoded in whatever native filtering mechanism the datastores have
 *
 * <p>Given the vast majority of function are <em>stable</em> by the above definition only the fews
 * that aren't suitable for constant replacement during a single run against a feature collection
 * should be marked as <em>volatile</em>
