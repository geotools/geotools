/**
 * Defines the sort order, based on a property and ascending/descending.
 *
 * <p>Having SortBy at the Filter level is an interesting undertaking of Filter 1.1 support. Why you
 * ask? It is at the Same level as Filter, it is not *used* by Filter itself. The services that make
 * use of Filter, such as WFS are starting to make use of SortBy in the same breath.
 *
 * <p>Where is SortBy used:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WFS 1.1 Query
 *   <li>CSW 2.0.1 AbstractQuery
 * </ul>
 *
 * There may be more ...
 *
 * <p>What this means is that the GeoTools Query will make use of this construct. As for sorting the
 * result of an expression (where an expression matches more then one element), we will splice it in
 * to AttributeExpression as an optional parameter. Note function is defined to return a single
 * value (so we don't need to worry there).
 *
