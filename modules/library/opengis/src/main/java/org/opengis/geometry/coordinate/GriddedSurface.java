/**
 * A {@linkplain ParametricCurveSurface parametric curve surface} defined from a rectangular grid in
 * the parameter space. The rows from this grid are control points for horizontal surface curves;
 * the columns are control points for vertical surface curves. The working assumption is that for a
 * pair of parametric coordinates (<var>s</var>,&nbsp;<var>t</var>), that the horizontal curves for
 * each integer offset are calculated and evaluated at <var>s</var>. This defines a sequence of
 * control points:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * &lt;c<sub>n</sub>(<var>s</var>) : <var>s</var> = 1 &hellip; columns&gt;
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * From this sequence, a vertical curve is calculated for <var>s</var>, and evaluated at
 * <var>t</var>. In most cases, the order of calculation (horizontal-vertical versus
 * vertical-horizontal) does not make a difference. Where it does, the horizontal-vertical order
 * shall be the one used.
 *
 * <p>The most common case of a gridded surface is a 2D spline. In this case the weight functions
 * for each parameter make order of calculation unimportant:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * TODO: copy equations there
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Logically, any pair of curve interpolation types can lead to a subtype of {@code GriddedSurface}.
 * The sub-interfaces provided in this package define some of the most commonly encountered surfaces
 * that can be represented in this manner.
