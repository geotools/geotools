/**
 * Curve with a positive orientation. {@code Curve} is a descendent subtype of {@link Primitive}
 * through {@link OrientablePrimitive}. It is the basis for 1-dimensional geometry. A curve is a
 * continuous image of an open interval and so could be written as a parameterized function such as
 * <code>c(t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code> where "t" is a real parameter and
 * E<sup>n</sup> is Euclidean space of dimension <var>n</var> (usually 2 or 3, as determined by the
 * coordinate reference system). Any other parameterization that results in the same image curve,
 * traced in the same direction, such as any linear shifts and positive scales such as <code>
 * e(t) = c(a&nbsp;+&nbsp;t(b-a)):(0,1) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>,
 *
 * <p>is an equivalent representation of the same curve. For the sake of simplicity, {@code Curve}s
 * should be parameterized by arc length, so that the parameterization operation inherited from
 * {@link GenericCurve} will be valid for parameters between 0 and the length of the curve.
 *
 * <p>Curves are continuous, connected, and have a measurable length in terms of the coordinate
 * system. The orientation of the curve is determined by this parameterization, and is consistent
 * with the tangent function, which approximates the derivative function of the parameterization and
 * shall always point in the "forward" direction. The parameterization of the reversal of the curve
 * defined by <code>c(t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code> would be defined by a function of
 * the form <code>s(t) = c(a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;-&nbsp;t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>.
 *
 * <p>A curve is composed of one or more curve segments. Each curve segment within a curve may be
 * defined using a different interpolation method. The curve segments are connected to one another,
 * with the end point of each segment except the last being the start point of the next segment in
 * the segment list.
