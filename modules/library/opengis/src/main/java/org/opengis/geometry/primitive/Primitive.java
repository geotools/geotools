/**
 * Abstract root class of the geometric primitives. Its main purpose is to define the basic
 * "boundary" operation that ties the primitives in each dimension together. A geometric primitive
 * is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This
 * includes curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and surface
 * patches, respectively. Those curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the context
 * of a primitive.
 *
 * <p>Any geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of geometric
 * primitives. A collection of geometric primitives may or may not be a geometric complex. Geometric
 * complexes have additional properties such as closure by boundary operations and mutually
 * exclusive component parts. {@code Primitive} and {@link Complex} share most semantics, in the
 * meaning of operations and attributes. There is an exception in that a {@code Primitive} shall not
 * contain its boundary (except in the trivial case of {@linkplain Point point} where the boundary
 * is empty), while a {@linkplain Complex complex} shall contain its boundary in all cases.
