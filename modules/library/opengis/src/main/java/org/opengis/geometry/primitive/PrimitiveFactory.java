    /**
     * Returns an envelope as a primitive. An {@linkplain Envelope envelope} will often be used in
     * query operations, and therefore must have a cast operation that returns a {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.geometry.Geometry geometry}. The actual return of the operation depends upon the
     * dimension of the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate
     * reference system} and the extent of the {@linkplain Envelope envelope}. In a 2D system, the
     * primitive returned will be a {@linkplain Surface surface} (if the envelope does not collapse
     * to a point or line). In 3D systems, the usual return is a {@linkplain Solid solid}.
     *
     * <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> In the case where the {@linkplain Envelope envelope} is totally
     * contained in the domain of validity of its {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference system} object,
     * its associated {@linkplain Primitive primitive} is the convex hull of the various
     * permutations of the coordinates in the corners. For example, suppose that a particular
     * envelope in 2D is defined as:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <pre>
     * lowerCorner = (x1, y1)
     * upperCorner = (x2, y2)</pre>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * (we ignore the CRS below, assuming that it is a global variable), then we can take the
     * various permutations of the ordinate values to create a list of polygon corners:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@link org.opengis.geometry.aggregate.MultiPoint} = { (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), (x2, y2) }
     * </pre>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * If we then apply the {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.Geometry#getConvexHull convex hull}
     * function to the multi point, we get a polygon as a {@linkplain Surface surface}. The extent
     * of a polygon in 2D is totally defined by its {@linkplain
     * org.opengis.geometry.Geometry#getBoundary boundary} (internal surface patches are planar and
     * do not need interior control points) which gives us a data type to represent {@linkplain
     * Surface surface} in 2D:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Ring} = {
     *     {@link org.opengis.geometry.coordinate.LineString} = { (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y2), (x2, y1), (x1, y1)}
     * }</pre>
     *
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * So that the {@linkplain SurfaceBoundary surface boundary} record contains the above-cited
     * exterior ring, and an empty set of interior rings (convex sets have no "interior" holes).
