/**
 * A coordinate reference system describing the position of points through two or more independent
 * coordinate reference systems. Thus it is associated with two or more {@linkplain
 * org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem Coordinate Systems} and {@linkplain
 * org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum Datums} by defining the compound CRS as an ordered set of two
 * or more instances of {@link CoordinateReferenceSystem}.
 *
 * <p>In general, a Compound CRS may contain any number of axes. The Compound CRS contains an
 * ordered set of coordinate reference systems and the tuple order of a compound coordinate set
 * shall follow that order, while the subsets of the tuple, described by each of the composing
 * coordinate reference systems, follow the tuple order valid for their respective coordinate
 * reference systems.
 *
 * <p>For spatial coordinates, a number of constraints exist for the construction of Compound CRSs.
 * For example, the coordinate reference systems that are combined should not contain any duplicate
 * or redundant axes. Valid combinations include:
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Geographic 2D + Vertical
 *   <LI>Geographic 2D + Engineering 1D (near vertical)
 *   <LI>Projected + Vertical
 *   <LI>Projected + Engineering 1D (near vertical)
 *   <LI>Engineering (horizontal 2D or 1D linear) + Vertical
 * </UL>
 *
 * <p>Any coordinate reference system, or any of the above listed combinations of coordinate
 * reference systems, can have a Temporal CRS added. More than one Temporal CRS may be added if
 * these axes represent different time quantities. For example, the oil industry sometimes uses "4D
 * seismic", by which is meant seismic data with the vertical axis expressed in milliseconds (signal
 * travel time). A second time axis indicates how it changes with time (years), e.g. as a reservoir
 * is gradually exhausted of its recoverable oil or gas).
