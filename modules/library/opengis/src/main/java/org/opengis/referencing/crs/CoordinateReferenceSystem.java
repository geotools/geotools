/**
 * Abstract coordinate reference system, usually defined by a {@linkplain
 * org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate system} and a {@linkplain
 * org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datum}. The concept of a coordinate reference system (CRS)
 * captures the choice of values for the parameters that constitute the degrees of freedom of the
 * coordinate space. The fact that such a choice has to be made, either arbitrarily or by adopting
 * values from survey measurements, leads to the large number of coordinate reference systems in use
 * around the world. It is also the cause of the little understood fact that the latitude and
 * longitude of a point are not unique. Without the full specification of the coordinate reference
 * system, coordinates are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst. However for some interchange
 * purposes it is sufficient to confirm the {@linkplain #getName identity of the system} without
 * necessarily having the full system definition.
 *
 * <p>The concept of coordinates may be expanded from a strictly spatial context to include time.
 * Time is then added as another coordinate to the coordinate tuple. It is even possible to add two
 * time-coordinates, provided the two coordinates describe different independent quantities. An
 * example of the latter is the time/space position of a subsurface point of which the vertical
 * coordinate is expressed as the two-way travel time of a sound signal in milliseconds, as is
 * common in seismic imaging. A second time-coordinate indicates the time of observation, usually
 * expressed in whole years.
