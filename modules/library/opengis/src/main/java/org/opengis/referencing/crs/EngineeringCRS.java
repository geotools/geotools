/**
 * A contextually local coordinate reference system. It can be divided into two broad categories:
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>earth-fixed systems applied to engineering activities on or near the surface of the earth;
 *   <li>CRSs on moving platforms such as road vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or spacecraft.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Earth-fixed Engineering CRSs are commonly based on a simple flat-earth approximation of the
 * earth's surface, and the effect of earth curvature on feature geometry is ignored: calculations
 * on coordinates use simple plane arithmetic without any corrections for earth curvature. The
 * application of such Engineering CRSs to relatively small areas and "contextually local" is in
 * this case equivalent to "spatially local".
 *
 * <p>Engineering CRSs used on moving platforms are usually intermediate coordinate reference
 * systems that are computationally required to calculate coordinates referenced to {@linkplain
 * GeocentricCRS geocentric}, {@linkplain GeographicCRS geographic} or {@linkplain ProjectedCRS
 * projected} CRSs. These engineering coordinate reference systems are subject to all the motions of
 * the platform with which they are associated. In this case "contextually local" means that the
 * associated coordinates are meaningful only relative to the moving platform. Earth curvature is
 * usually irrelevant and is therefore ignored. In the spatial sense their applicability may extend
 * from the immediate vicinity of the platform (e.g. a moving seismic ship) to the entire earth
 * (e.g. in space applications). The determining factor is the mathematical model deployed in the
 * positioning calculations. Transformation of coordinates from these moving Engineering CRSs to
 * earth-referenced coordinate reference systems involves time-dependent coordinate operation
 * parameters.
