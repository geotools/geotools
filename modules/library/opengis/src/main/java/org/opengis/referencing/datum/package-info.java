/**
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum Geodetic datum} (the relationship of a
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate system} to the earth). The
 * following is adapted from <A
 * HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6716">OpenGIS&reg; Spatial Referencing
 * by Coordinates (Topic 2)</A> specification.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">A datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth or, in
 * some applications to an Engineering CRS, to a moving platform, thus creating a coordinate
 * reference system. A datum can be used as the basis for one-, two- or three-dimensional systems.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Five subtypes of datum are specified: geodetic, vertical, engineering, image
 * and temporal. Each datum subtype can be associated only with specific types of coordinate
 * reference systems. A geodetic datum is used with three-dimensional or horizontal
 * (two-dimensional) coordinate reference systems, and requires an ellipsoid definition and a prime
 * meridian definition. It is used to describe large portions of the earth's surface up to the
 * entire earth's surface. A vertical datum can only be associated with a vertical coordinate
 * reference system. Image datum and engineering datum are both used in a local context only: to
 * describe the origin of an image and the origin of an engineering (or local) coordinate reference
 * system.
 *
 * <p>&nbsp;
 *
 * <H3>Vertical datum</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Further sub-typing is required to describe vertical datums adequately. The
 * following types of vertical datum are distinguished:
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Geoidal</STRONG><br>
 *       The zero value of the associated (vertical) coordinate system axis is defined to
 *       approximate a constant potential surface, usually the geoid. Such a reference surface is
 *       usually determined by a national or scientific authority and is then a wellknown, named
 *       datum. This is the default vertical datum type, because it is the most common one
 *       encountered.
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Depth</STRONG><br>
 *       The zero point of the vertical axis is defined by a surface that has meaning for the
 *       purpose the associated vertical measurements are used for. For hydrographic charts, this is
 *       often a predicted nominal sea surface (i.e., without waves or other wind and current
 *       effects) that occurs at low tide. Examples are Lowest Astronomical Tide and Lowest Low
 *       Water Spring. A different example is a sloping and undulating River Datum defined as the
 *       nominal river water surface occurring at a quantified river discharge.
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Barometric</STRONG><br>
 *       A vertical datum is of type "barometric" if atmospheric pressure is the basis for the
 *       definition of the origin. Atmospheric pressure may be used as the intermediary to determine
 *       height (barometric height determination) or it may be used directly as the vertical
 *       ordinate, against which other parameters are measured. The latter case is applied routinely
 *       in meteorology.
 *       <P ALIGN="justify">Barometric height determination is routinely used in aircraft. The
 *       altimeter (barometer) on board is set to the altitude of the airfield at the time of
 *       take-off, which corrects simultaneously for instantaneous air pressure and altitude of the
 *       airfield. The measured height value is commonly named "altitude".
 *       <P ALIGN="justify">In some land surveying applications height differences between points
 *       are measured with barometers. To obtain absolute heights the measured height differences
 *       are added to the known heights of control points. In that case the vertical datum type is
 *       not barometric, but is the same as that of the vertical control network used to obtain the
 *       heights of the new points and its vertical datum type.
 *       <P ALIGN="justify">The accuracy of this technique is limited, as it is affected strongly by
 *       the spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric pressure. This accuracy limitation
 *       impacts the precision of the associated vertical datum definition. The datum is usually the
 *       surface of constant atmospheric pressure approximately equating to mean sea level (MSL).
 *       The origin or anchor point is usually a point of known MSL height. The instruments are
 *       calibrated at this point by correcting for the instantaneous atmospheric pressure at sea
 *       level and the height of the point above MSL.
 *       <P ALIGN="justify">In meteorology, atmospheric pressure routinely takes the role as
 *       vertical ordinate in a CRS that is used as a spatial reference frame for meteorological
 *       parameters in the upper atmosphere. The origin of the datum is in that case the
 *       (hypothetical) zero atmospheric pressure and the positive vertical axis points down (to
 *       increasing pressure).
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><STRONG>Other surface</STRONG><br>
 *       In some cases, e.g. oil exploration and production, geological features, i.e., the top or
 *       bottom of a geologically identifiable and meaningful subsurface layer, are sometimes used
 *       as a vertical datum. Other variations to the above three vertical datum types may exist and
 *       are all bracketed in this category.
 * </UL>

 *
 * <H3>Image datum</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The image pixel grid is defined as the set of lines of constant integer
 * ordinate values. The term "image grid" is often used in other standards to describe the concept
 * of Image CRS. However, care must be taken to correctly interpret this term in the context in
 * which it is used. The term "grid cell" is often used as a substitute for the term "pixel".
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The grid lines of the image may be associated in two ways with the data
 * attributes of the pixel or grid cell (ISO CD 19123). The data attributes of the image usually
 * represent an average or integrated value that is associated with the entire pixel.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">An image grid can be associated with this data in such a way that the grid
 * lines run through the centres of the pixels. The cell centres will thus have integer coordinate
 * values. In that case the attribute "pixel in cell" will have the value "cell centre".
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Alternatively the image grid may be defined such that the grid lines associate
 * with the cell or pixel corners rather than the cell centres. The cell centres will thus have
 * noninteger coordinate values, the fractional parts always being 0.5. ISO CD 19123 calls the grid
 * points in this latter case "posts" and associated image data: "matrix data". The attribute "pixel
 * in cell" will now have the value "cell corner".
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">This difference in perspective has no effect on the image interpretation, but
 * is important for coordinate transformations involving this defined image.
 *
 * <p>&nbsp;
 *
 * <H3>Prime meridian</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">A prime meridian defines the origin from which longitude values are specified.
 * Most geodetic datums use Greenwich as their prime meridian. A prime meridian description is not
 * needed for any datum type other than geodetic, or if the datum type is geodetic and the prime
 * meridian is Greenwich. The prime meridian description is mandatory if the datum type is geodetic
 * and its prime meridian is not Greenwich.
 *
 * <p>&nbsp;
 *
 * <H3>Ellipsoid</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">An ellipsoid is defined that approximates the surface of the geoid. Because of
 * the area for which the approximation is valid - traditionally regionally, but with the advent of
 * satellite positioning often globally - the ellipsoid is typically associated with Geographic and
 * Projected CRSs. An ellipsoid specification shall not be provided if the datum type not geodetic.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">One ellipsoid must be specified with every geodetic datum, even if the
 * ellipsoid is not used computationally. The latter may be the case when a Geocentric CRS is used,
 * e.g., in the calculation of satellite orbit and ground positions from satellite observations.
 * Although use of a Geocentric CRS apparently obviates the need of an ellipsoid, the ellipsoid
 * usually played a role in the determination of the associated geodetic datum. Furthermore one or
 * more Geographic CRSs may be based on the same geodetic datum, which requires the correct
 * ellipsoid the associated with any given geodetic datum.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">An ellipsoid is defined either by its semi-major axis and inverse flattening,
 * or by its semimajor axis and semi-minor axis. For some applications, for example small-scale
 * mapping in atlases, a spherical approximation of the geoid's surface is used, requiring only the
 * radius of the sphere to be specified.
