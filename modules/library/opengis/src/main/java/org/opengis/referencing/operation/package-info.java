 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.CoordinateOperation Coordinate operations}
 * (relationship between any two {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem
 * coordinate reference systems}). The following is adapted from <A
 * HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=6716">OpenGIS&reg; Spatial Referencing
 * by Coordinates (Topic 2)</A> specification.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">If the relationship between any two coordinate reference systems is known,
 * coordinates can be transformed or converted to another coordinate reference system. The UML model
 * therefore specifies a source and a target coordinate reference system for such coordinate
 * operations. For that reason, a coordinate operation is often popularly said to "transform
 * coordinate reference system <VAR>A</VAR> into coordinate reference system <VAR>B</VAR>". Although
 * this wording may be good enough for conversation, it should be realised that coordinate
 * operations do not operate on coordinate reference systems, but on coordinates.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Coordinate operations are divided into two subtypes:
 *
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><EM>Coordinate conversion</EM> - mathematical operation on coordinates
 *       that does not include any change of Datum. The best-known example of a coordinate
 *       conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are
 *       defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.
 *   <LI>
 *       <P ALIGN="justify"><EM>Coordinate transformation</EM> - mathematical operation on
 *       coordinates that usually includes a change of Datum. The parameters of a coordinate
 *       transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of
 *       points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually
 *       'over-determined', allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the
 *       transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple
 *       (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation. Because of this several
 *       transformations may exist for a given pair of coordinate reference systems, differing in
 *       their transformation method, parameter values and accuracy characteristics.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">A coordinate operation (transformation or conversion) can be time-varying, and
 * must be time-varying if either the source or target CRS is time varying. When the coordinate
 * operation is time-varying, the operation method used will also be time-varying, and some of the
 * parameters used by that operation method will involve time. For example, some of the parameters
 * may have time, velocity, and/or acceleration values and units.
 *
 * <H3>Coordinate conversions</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Coordinate conversions are coordinate operations that make use of exact,
 * defined (rather than measured or computed), and therefore error-free parameter values.
 * Corresponding pairs of coordinate tuples in each of the two coordinate reference systems
 * connected through a coordinate conversion have a fixed arithmetic relationship. Additionally one
 * of the two tuples cannot exist without specification of the coordinate conversion and the
 * 'source' coordinate reference system. Coordinate conversions are therefore intimately related to
 * the concept of {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.DerivedCRS Derived CRS}.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The best-known example of this source-derived relationship is a {@linkplain
 * org.opengis.referencing.crs.ProjectedCRS projected coordinate reference system}, which is always
 * based on a source {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeographicCRS geographic coordinate
 * reference system}. The associated map projection effectively defines the projected coordinate
 * reference system from the geographic coordinate system.
 *
 * <H3>Concatenated coordinate operation</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">A concatenated coordinate operation is an ordered sequence of coordinate
 * operations. The sequence of operations is constrained by the requirement that the source
 * coordinate reference system of step (<VAR>n</VAR>+1) must be the same as the target coordinate
 * reference system of step (<VAR>n</VAR>). The source coordinate reference system of the first step
 * and the target coordinate reference system of the last step are the source and target coordinate
 * reference system associated with the concatenated operation.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The above constraint should not be interpreted as implying that only those
 * coordinate operations can be used in a concatenated operation that have their source and a target
 * coordinate reference system specified through the association pair between {@link
 * org.opengis.referencing.operation.CoordinateOperation} and {@link
 * org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem}. This would exclude coordinate
 * conversions. Concatenated coordinate operations may contain coordinate transformations and/or
 * coordinate conversions.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The source and target coordinate reference system of a coordinate conversion
 * are defined in the {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeneralDerivedCRS}, by specifying the base
 * (i.e., source) CRS and the defining conversion. The derived coordinate reference system itself is
 * the target CRS in this situation. When used in a concatenated operation, the conversion's source
 * and target coordinate reference system are equally subject to the above constraint as the source
 * and target of a transformation although they are specified in a different manner.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The concatenated coordinate operation class is primarily intended to provide a
 * mechanism that forces application software to use a preferred path to go from source to target
 * coordinate reference system, if a direct transformation between the two is not available.
 *
 * <H3>Pass-through coordinate operation</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Coordinate operations require input coordinate tuples of certain dimensions
 * and produce output tuples of certain dimensions. The dimensions of these coordinate tuples and
 * the dimensions of the coordinate reference system they are defined in must be the same.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The ability to define compound coordinate reference systems combining two or
 * more other coordinate reference systems, not themselves compound, introduces a difficulty. For
 * example, it may be required to transform only the horizontal or only the vertical component of a
 * compound coordinate reference system, which will put them at odds with coordinate operations
 * specified for either horizontal or vertical coordinates only. To the human mind this is a trivial
 * problem, but not so for coordinate transformation software that ought to be capable of automatic
 * operation, without human intervention; the software logic would be confronted with the problem of
 * having to apply a 2-dimensional coordinate operation to 3-dimensional coordinate tuples.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">This problem has been solved by defining a pass-through operation. This
 * operation specifies what subset of a coordinate tuple is subject to a requested transformation.
 * It takes the form of referencing another coordinate operation and specifying a sequence of
 * numbers defining the positions in the coordinate tuple of the coordinates affected by that
 * transformation. The order of the coordinates in a coordinate tuple shall agree with the order of
 * the coordinate system axes as defined for the associated coordinate system.
 *
 * <H3>Operation method and parameters</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The algorithm used to execute the coordinate operation is defined in the
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.OperationMethod operation method}. Concatenated
 * operations and pass-through operations do not require a coordinate operation to be specified.
 * Each {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.OperationMethod operation method} uses a
 * number of {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.ParameterValue parameters} (although some coordinate
 * conversions use none), and each {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.CoordinateOperation
 * coordinate operation} assigns value to these parameters.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">As this class comes close to the heart of any coordinate transformation
 * software, it is recommended to make extensive use of identifiers, referencing well-known datasets
 * wherever possible. There is as yet no standard way of spelling or even naming the various
 * coordinate operation methods. Client software requesting a coordinate operation to be executed by
 * a coordinate transformation server implementation may therefore ask for an operation method this
 * server doesn't recognise, although a perfectly valid method may be available. The same holds for
 * coordinate operation parameters used by any coordinate operation method. To facilitate
 * recognition and validation it is recommended that the operation formulae be included or
 * referenced in the relevant object, and if possible a worked example.
 *
 * <H3>Implementation considerations</H3>
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">This explanation is not complete without giving some thought to
 * implementations. Coordinate transformation services should be able to automatically derive
 * coordinate operations that are not stored explicitly in any permanent data store, in other words
 * determine their own concatenated or inverse operations. The reason is that is practically
 * impossible to store all possible pairs of coordinate reference systems in explicitly defined
 * coordinate operations. The key to a successful software implementation is the ability to apply
 * meaningful constraints and validations to this process. For example: it may be mathematically
 * possible to derive a concatenated coordinate operation that will transform North American Datum
 * 1983 coordinates to Australian National Datum; but in a practical sense that operation would be
 * meaningless. The key validation that would flag such an operation as invalid would be a
 * comparison of the two areas of validity and the conclusion that there is no overlap between
 * these.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Coordinate transformation services should also be able to derive or infer the
 * inverse of any coordinate operation (from <VAR>B</VAR> to <VAR>A</VAR>) from its complementary
 * forward operation (<VAR>A</VAR> to <VAR>B</VAR>). Most permanent data stores for coordinate
 * reference parameter data will record only one of the two operations that may exist between any
 * two coordinate reference systems. The inverse operation is then inferred by the application
 * software logic from the stored operation.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">In some cases, the algorithm for the inverse operation is the same as the
 * forward algorithm, and only the signs of the parameter values need to be reversed for the inverse
 * operation to be fully defined. An example is the 7-parameter Helmert transformation (both
 * position vector and coordinate frame rotation convention).
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Some polynomial coordinate operations require the signs of only most, but not
 * all, parameter values to be reversed. Other coordinate operation methods imply two algorithms,
 * one for the forward and one for the inverse operation. The parameters are generally the same in
 * that case. The latter situation generally applies to map projections.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">Finally the same algorithm may be used for the inverse operation, with
 * entirely different parameter values. This is the case with some polynomial and affine operations.
 * In those cases the inverse operation cannot be inferred from the forward operation but must be
 * explicitly defined.
 *
 * <P ALIGN="justify">The logic to derive the inverse transformation should be built into the
 * application software, be it server or client, that performs the coordinate operation.
