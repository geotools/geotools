/**
 * A Graphic is a "graphic symbol" with an inherent shape, color(s), and possibly size. A "graphic"
 * can be very informally defined as "a little picture" and can be of either a raster or
 * vector-graphic source type. The term "graphic" is used since the term "symbol" is similar to
 * "Symbolizer" which is used in a different context in SE.
