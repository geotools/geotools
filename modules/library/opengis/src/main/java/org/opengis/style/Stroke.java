/**
 * Contains all the information needed to draw styled lines. Stroke objects are contained by {@link
 * LineSymbol}s and {@link PolygonSymbol}s. There are three basic types of strokes: solid-color,
 * {@code GraphicFill} (stipple), and repeated linear {@code GraphicStroke}. A repeated linear
 * graphic is plotted linearly and has its graphic symbol bent around the curves of the line string,
 * and a graphic fill has the pixels of the line rendered with a repeating area-fill pattern. If
 * neither a {@link #getGraphicFill GraphicFill} nor {@link #getGraphicStroke GraphicStroke} element
 * is given, then the line symbolizer will render a solid color.
