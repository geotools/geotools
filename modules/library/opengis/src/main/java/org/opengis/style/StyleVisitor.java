/**
 * An interface for classes that want to perform operations on a Style hierarchy. It forms part of a
 * GoF Visitor Pattern implementation.
 *
 * <p>A call to style.accept(StyleVisitor) will result in a call to one of the methods in this
 * interface. The responsibility for traversing sub filters is intended to lie with the visitor
 * (this is unusual, but permitted under the Visitor pattern).
 *
 * <p>A typical use would be to transcribe a style into a specific format, e.g. XML or SQL.
 * Alternatively it may be to extract specific information from the Style structure, for example a
 * list of all fills. Finally a a style visitor is often used (in conjunction with a factory) in the
 * production of a copy; or slightly modified copy of the original style.
 *
 * <p>It is common practice for a StyleVisitor to also implement an ExpressionVisitor in order to
 * traverse both data structures.
