/**
 * Indicates that it is legal to make a field-for-field copy of instances of implementing classes. A
 * cloneable class implements the J2SE's {@link java.lang.Cloneable} standard interface and
 * additionnaly overrides the {@link Object#clone()} method with public access.
 *
 * <p>Because the {@link Object#clone()} method has protected access, containers wanting to clone
 * theirs elements need to 1) use Java reflection (which is less efficient than standard method
 * calls), or 2) cast every elements to a specific type like {@link java.util.Date} (which may
 * require a large amount of "{@code if (x instanceof y)}" checks if arbitrary classes are allowed).
 * This {@code Cloneable} interface had a third alternative: checks only for this interface instead
 * of a list of particular cases.
 *
 * <p>Implementors of cloneable classes may consider implementing this interface, but this is not
 * mandatory. A large amount of independant classes like {@link java.util.Date} will continue to
 * ignore this interface, so no rule can be enforced anyway. However this interface may help the
 * work of containers in some case. For example a container may checks for this interface first, and
 * uses Java reflection as a fallback.
