 * series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually
 * "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation.
 * Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the
 * same coordinate transformation.
