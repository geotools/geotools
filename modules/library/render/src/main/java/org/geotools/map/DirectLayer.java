/**
 * A Layer directly responsible for its own rendering.
 *
 * <p>Direct layers are responsible for their own rendering and are useful for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Map Decorations such as legends or scalebars that depend only on the map and viewport and
 *       do not actually make use of external data.
 *   <li>Data services that are visual in nature, such as a Web Map Service (which you can think of
 *       as an external renderer)
 *   <li>You may also consider data formats, such as CAD files, where the style information is
 *       "baked into" the data format as suitable for a DirectLayer. In these cases you are only
 *       going for a visual display and are not making the raw features available to the geotools
 *       library for use.
 * </ul>
 *
 * While any and all data sources could be wrapped up as a DirectLayer we encourage you to consider
 * a separate data mode, style model and renderer.
