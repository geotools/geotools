/**
 * This is a simple class that contains the information needed to render a layer.
 * 
 * Basically, for a SLD, you create one of these for each of the FeatureTypeStyles inside it.
 * LiteRenderer uses this to do the actual renderering.
 * 
 * It contains: a. a BufferedImage so lite knows where to do the drawing b. a list of rules (minimal
 * # -- ie. remove the ones that dont apply to this scale) c. "else" rule list
 * 
 * To process this, you would a) foreach FEATURE b) foreach LiteFeatureTypeStyle c) <process rules
 * and draw to the appropriate image> d) combine the images
 * 
 * This was setup so you can "parallelize" literenderer in the simple way -- only read data once.
 * The old implementation would re-read the data for each one FeatureTypeStyle.
 * 
 * NOTE: a) the SLD spec says that each FeatureTypeStyle is rendered in order & independently b) If
 * you have a request like LAYERS=a,a&STYLES=a_style1,a_styel2 then you could optimize to something
 * like this (!!)
 * 
 * NOTE: a) this also sets up the image -- clears it et al.
