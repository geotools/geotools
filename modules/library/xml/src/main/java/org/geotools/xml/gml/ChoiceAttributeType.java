     * <p>Consider a choice between Polygon and MultiPolygon. It doesn't make sense to be a Geometry
     * Attribute Type since normal attribute type inspection will allow users/clients to set Points
     * and lines as legal attribute. For parsing purposes, this make the FeatureType a little more
     * accurate. It is not perfect of course since The choice Line, Polygon and MultiPolygon still
     * has to be of Type Geometry but it is a little better.
