 * This Interface is intended to represent the public portion of an XML Schema.
 * By public portion, I mean the portion of the Schema which can be included
 * in an instance document, or imported into another Schema.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The distinction between the public portion of a XML Schema and the entire
 * XML Schema is or particular important when comparing, or printing two XML
 * Schemas. This interface does is intended to provide enough information to
 * re-create the original Schema (note the lack or annotations as an example).
 * This interface is however intended to provide functional semantic
 * equivalence. By this is mean that two XML Schemas represented using this
 * interface should have the same SET of declarations. There is no guarantee
 * that the Schema represented matches the original document with respect to
 * orderwithin the sets, except where order is explicitly defined (Sequence,
 * Choice).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This method must be inplemented within extensions:  public static Schema
 * getInstance();. It will be used by the Schema factory to  load the required
 * extensions into memory.
