    <documentation>This XML Schema Document encodes the typical Contents
    section of an OWS service metadata (Capabilities) document. This Schema
    can be built upon to define the Contents section for a specific OWS. If
    the ContentsBaseType in this XML Schema cannot be restricted and extended
    to define the Contents section for a specific OWS, all other relevant
    parts defined in owsContents.xsd shall be used by the "ContentsType" in
    the wxsContents.xsd prepared for the specific OWS.
    
    OWS is an OGC Standard.
