/**
 * An Iterator like interface to read ArcSDE rasters for a given ArcSDE raster dataset (whether it
 * is a single raster or a raster catalog).
 *
 * <p>Sample usage: <code>
 * <pre>
 * RasterReaderFactory readerFactory = ....
 * RasterDatasetInfo raserInfo = ...
 * ArcSDERasterReader reader = readerFactory.create(rasterInfo);
 * try{
 *      Long nextRasterId;
 *      while((nextRasterId = reader.nextRaster()) != null){
 *          if(amIInterestedInThisRaster(nextRasterId)){
 *              int pyramidLevel = ...
 *              Rectangle tileRange = ...
 *              RenderedImage raster = reader.read(pyramidLevel, tileRange);
 *          }
 *      }
 * }finally{
 *      reader.dispose();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>So one has to call {@code nextRaster()} to get the id of the raster immediately available to
 * be read through {@link #read()}. This is so because there might be more than one raster on a
 * raster dataset and the order they are fetched from the ArcSDE server is non deterministic, and
 * once you opened a stream to a raster you can't open another one and then read the former.
