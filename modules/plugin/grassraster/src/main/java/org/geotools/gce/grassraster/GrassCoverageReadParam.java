/**
 * Represents the read parameters in the geotools space, as opposed to {@linkplain
 * GrassBinaryImageReadParam} that are for the imageio space.
 *
 * <p>Represents the parameters needed by the {@linkplain GrassCoverageReader} for reading coverage,
 * i.e. the portion and resolution of the map you want to get from the GridCoverageReader.
 *
 * <p>The needed parameters to read a GRASS raster map, are the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the northern boundary coordinate
 *   <li>the southern boundary coordinate
 *   <li>the eastern boundary coordinate
 *   <li>the western boundary coordinate
 *   <li>the north-south or west-east resolution
 *   <li>the number of rows and columns
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All these values are already handled in the {@linkplain JGrassRegion}, so that has to be
 * supplied in order to choose a region different from the native data region. <b>Note:</b> it is
 * enough to have bounds and row-cols, or bounds and resolutions, or also a corner and row-cols and
 * resolutions.
