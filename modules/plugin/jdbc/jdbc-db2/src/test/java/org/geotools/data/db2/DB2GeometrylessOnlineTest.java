     * This method always fails due to fw.write() in the parent class. This is due to some DB2 JDBC
     * functions not working correctly.
     *
     * <p>1. DB2SQLDialect should implement lookupGeneratedValuesPostInsert(), returning true so
     * that key columns are not included in the insert operation when the primary key is
     * autogenerated. 2. When this change is made, JDBCDataStore::insertPS uses
     * cx.prepareStatement(sql, keysFetcher.getColumnNames()) in order to tell DB2 which columns to
     * get autogenerated key values for. Unfortunately, when the key column name is lower-case, DB2
     * defaults to the upper-case value and the ps.AddBatch() for the insert subsequently fails with
     * SQLCODE -206 because the upper-case value doesn't match the actual lower-case key column
     * name. This fails at ps.addBatch() in JDBCDataStore::insertPS 3. Changing the primary key to
     * upper-case (FID), allows ps.addBatch to succeed and then KeysFetcher::postInsert is called
     * but this fails due to ps.getGeneratedKeys() which is broken when ps.AddBatch() is used. The
     * ResultSet is empty instead of returning the keys which causes subsequent failures. This is
     * known by the DB2 JDBC development team but is not likely to be fixed. 4. Changing the primary
     * key to upper-case is not viable because JDBCInsertFeatureWriter::flush() has the primary key
     * hard-coded as "fid".
