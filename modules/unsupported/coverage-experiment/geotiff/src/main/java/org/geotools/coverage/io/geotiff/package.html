  <BODY>
    A grid coverage exchange to manage the GeoTIFF Revision 1.0 format. 

    <p>
    This package is going to be &quot;evolutionary&quot;, rather than 
    &quot;revolutionary&quot;.   As functionality is added to the package, 
    this page will be updated.  This page should be considered a current 
    synopsis of the capabilities of the module.  

    <h1>Revision Date</h1>
    May 31, 2005
    
    <p>
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    This package requires that the runtime environment have access to 
    Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) and the JAI Image I/O extensions available
    from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">Sun</A>.  Specifically, the 
    <code>GeoTiffFormatFactorySpi</code>
    will report itself unavailable if any of the following are unavailable:
    <ul>
    <li> <code>javax.media.jai.JAI</code>
    <li> <code>com.sun.media.jai.operator.ImageReadDescriptor</code>
    <li> <code>com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.tiff.GeoTIFFTagSet</code>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Other classes are of course necessary to successfully read in the GeoTIFF 
    image.  As they typically come bundled with one or more of the above, 
    they are assumed to be present if all of the above are present.

    <h2>CRS Information</h2>
    <p>
    The ability of the GeoTiff module to <i>interpret</i> and <i>accurately 
    express</i> the geographic information encoded in the GeoTIFF file 
    relies strongly on it's ability to use the Geotools framework to 
    construct a meaningful coordinate reference system (CRS) object.  Geotools 
    has a number of <i>Authority Factories</i> which take care of constructing
    CRS information given the code assigned to that CRS. 

    <p>
    The central problem is that a complete CRS is composed of many smaller 
    pieces (coordinate systems (CS), datums, and coordinate operations.)  Each
    of these smaller peices is assigned a code for berevity.  So when a 
    GeoTIFF file is written, the coordinate information can either be a 
    single code representing the entire CRS (if you're lucky), or a combination
    of each of the component codes.  Reading a GeoTIFF involves the reverse 
    process: looking up either a single code or a collection of the 
    component codes and building up a CRS object from these components.

    <p>
    Geotools supports the looking up of EPSG codes in plugins.  Therefore it
    is critical that the environment inside which the GeoTIFF plugin is 
    running contain the appropriate epsg authority factory plugins. 
    Unfortunately, the definition of &quot;appropriate&quot; varies according
    to the type of GeoTIFF file you are trying to read.  If you know that 
    your GeoTIFF file contains only codes for complete CRSes, then you
    can use an EPSG plugin which only looks up complete CRSes (e.g., 
    epsg-wkt, the property file based EPSG authority factory.)  If, however,
    you want to be able to handle more types of GeoTIFF files (perhaps you
    do not know where your GeoTIFF files are coming from), you must choose 
    an EPSG authority factory which can lookup components of a CRS 
    (e.g., epsg-access, the MS Access backed authority factory.)

    <p>
    In short, the exact means by which EPSG codes are turned into 
    actual Java Objects is left up to the application writer.  Ensure that 
    the capabilities you have configured match the requirements imposed by
    the data you are trying to read.
    
    <p>
    <h1>Current Functionality</h1>
    <p>
    The current iteration of the GeoTIFF plugin will read GeoTIFF files with the 
    following restrictions:
    <ul>
    <li> The coordinate system must be either projected or geographic 
        (geodetic coordinate systems not supported.)
    <li> The EPSG authority factory plugin chosen by the application writer
      must successfully construct everything necessary to represent the 
      scene coordinates.
    <li> The Raster to Model transformation must be a simple translation.
    <li> This plugin does not use the &quot;Hints&quot; mechanism as of yet.
         I don't know how to have the user specify the EPSG factories they
         wish to use.
    <li> When constructing a user defined projected CRS, the Cartesian CS
         associated with the system <i>always</i> has easting as the 
         first axis and northing as the second axis, and the units are 
         always the length units defined in the GeoTIFF file.  I do not 
         know if it is possible to have a different combination.
    </ul>

    <p>
    The GeoTIFF plugin currently does not write GeoTIFF files.  The 
    current obstacles to writing a GeoTIFF file are:
    <ol>
    <li> The <CODE>GeoTiffIIOMetadataAdapter</CODE> cannot modify the 
      IIOMetadata object (e.g., it's read-only).
    <li> No mechanism exists to examine the parameters of a coordinate
      system and produce an EPSG code.
    </ol>

    <p>Key features of the package: 
    <ol>
    <li>Has a reasonable level of isolation from the Geotools library
      ala the GeoAPI interfaces.  Areas of best isolation are CRS, and 
      areas of worst isolation are the grid coverage exchange API.
    <li>Utilizes the JAI ImageI/O tools to perform the actual file I/O.
    <li>Interprets metadata retrieved as <code>IIOMetadata</code>.
    <li>Functionality is logically subdivided:
      <ul> 
      <li> Classes required to interface to Geotools.
      <li> An adapter class to retrieve GeoKeys from the IIOMetadata by
        symbolic name (<CODE>GeoTiffIIOMetadataAdapter</CODE>).
      <li> An adapter class to interpret the values in the GeoKeys
        and create a corresponding coordinate system with a factory
        (<CODE>GeoTiffCoordinateSystemAdapter</CODE>).
      </ul>
    </ol>
