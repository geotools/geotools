==UnidataVariableAdapter==
- it still builds the envelope for each variable right now
- clean up creation of CRS, especially 3d
- fix initialization of CRS
- review creation of GridGeometry2D
- review computation of AffineTransform, I don't think we are handling the size of the pixels correctly. As an instance
I am not sure we are managing the size of the last pixel
- we are creating VerticalCRS and TemporalCRS for each variable right now, which is useless:
-- review creation of VerticalCRS
-- review creation of TemporalCRS

== General ==
- introdurre un oggetto che gestisca le CoordinateVariables ed i CRS per le variabili
- salvare il crs nell'indexer ?
- supporto PRJ o simile
