/**
 * This test required no changes, could be folded in the CQL family one. Findings:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>ECQL allowed the column already
 *   <li>The period is hopefully not going be a problem, as long as it's encoded back as a dot and
 *       not a /.
 *   <li>Interpretation of the period as a separator might be problematic though, CQL2 has no notion
 *       of nesting AFAIK (research is needed to confirm/deny).
