/*
 * The raster-color-map property specifies a series of colors to associate with
 * specific values in a raster. Note that this only applies with grey-scale
 * rasters - that is, when raster-color-map is used, it should always be in
 * conjunction with a raster-channels value specifying only a single value.
 *
 * A raster-color-map property consists at least one color map entry, created
 * by the color-map-entry function.  The color-map-entry must contain a CSS
 * color and a numeric value:
 * raster-color-map: color-map-entry(#ff0000, 0)
 *
 * Optionally, it may also include an opacity value:
 * raster-color-map: color-map-entry(#ff0000, 0, 0.5)
 *
 * By default values in between entries in the color map will have colors
 * smoothly interpolated.  This behavior can be controlled using the
 * raster-color-map-type property.
