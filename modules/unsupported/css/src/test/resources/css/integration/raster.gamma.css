/*
 * The raster-gamma property specifies a gamma correction
 * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) to be applied to the output raster.
 * Gamma correction has the general effect of brightening or darkening shadows
 * in the image.
 *
 * A gamma value of 1 leaves the image unaltered (this is the default).  Values
 * smaller than one darken the image, while values larger than one lighten it.
