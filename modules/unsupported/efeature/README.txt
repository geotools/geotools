 EFeature DataStore Implementation Comments
=====================================================================

Notice: plugin.xml, plugin.properties, build.properties
-------------------------------------------------------

These files are only here because testing the EMF model requires 
EMF Edit, which is only possible to generate if at least one plug-in 
class is defined. The plug-in IS NOT part of the Maven artifact.

=====================================================================
 EFeatureTest GenModel Setup Trick (merge all code into one plug-in)
=====================================================================
 
  > EMF Model, Edit and Test code should be generated (merged) into 
    the same plug-in: 
    
        org.geotools.data.efeature.tests.EFeatureTestsPlugin
    
    (reduces the number of maven artifacts needed)
            
  HOWTO: 
  ------
  
  1. Open file src/test/resources/model/efeature-tests.genmodel
  2. Select "EFeatureTest" (root)
  3. R-Clk -> select "Show Properties View"
  4. Expand "Model", enter "Model Directory", "Model Plug-in Class"
     and "Model Plug-in ID"
  5. Expand "Edit", enter same "Model Directory" as in step 3. This
     forces the Edit code to be generated into the same plug-in
     as the EFeatureTest model.
  6. Repeat step 4 for "Test"
  7. Ensure that "Editor" has no "Model Directory" and no 
     "Model Plug-in class". If forgotten, the Editor code is also
     generated by R-Clk on "EFeatureTest" -> "Generate All". If 
     successful, R-Clk on "EFeatureTest" -> "Generate Editor Code" 
     should be disabled.

=====================================================================
 EFeatureTest Build Procedure
=====================================================================
  
  1. Open file src/test/resources/model/efeature-tests.genmodel
  2. R-Clk on "EFeatureTest" (root) -> select "Generate All"

====================================================================
 EFeatureTest Build Troubleshooting
====================================================================

  1. "Generate All" produces many errors
  --------------------------------------
     
  If a lot of errors was produced by "Generate All", the property
  "EFeaureTest" -> "Templates & Merge" -> "Update Classpath" is
  probably "true", which overwrites the class-path built by the
  command "..efeature-tests> mvn eclipse:eclipse". This problem is
  easily fixed by executing "..efeature-tests> mvn eclipse:eclipse"
  one more time and then do a refresh at the "efeature-test" project
  root.
    
  2. Unit tests fails with error: 
  "java.io.FileNotFoundException: Can not locate test-data for "null"
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  The reason is that the folder is not built (for some reason). This
  can be verified by inspection of target/test-classes/.../tests. Is
  missing, just force a build of this folder. F.ex by renaming it to
  "test-data1" and then rename it back again to "test-data".
