/**
 * The class Dimension represents the dimension type of a Feature Geometry. It supports three
 * dimension types:
 *
 * <p>2D - Geometry objects in two dimensional euclidian space with the coordinates x and y.
 * Geometric objects in that dimension model do not store any information about height in their
 * geometry attributes.
 *
 * <p>2.5D - Geometry objects in three dimensional euclidian space with the coordinates x and y, and
 * owns a height attribute z. Therefore, each coordinate pair only holds one height information.
 * This relation can be defined by the bijectional function f(x,y) -> z.
 *
 * <p>3D - Geometry objects in three dimensional euclidian space with the coordinates x, y and z.
 * Since we are in real three dimensional space, coordinates with the same x and y values, but
 * different z values are allowed. This provides the representation of overlaying objects like
 * bridges over a river or tunels through a mountain.
 *
 * <p>The distinction between 2d (which is in 2 dimensional euclidian space) and 2.5d (which is in 2
 * dimensional euclidian space) objects is essential, because the simple disctinction between the
 * coordiante dimension (euclidian space) would make the seperation of 2d and 3d data impossible. In
 * fact, there is a huge discrepancy in algorithms and their runtime complexity in spatial operation
 * which treat 2d data and 3d data. 3D algorithms are usually absolutely ineffecient for 2D data, so
 * that a seperation between the two dimensionalities must be done. However, 2d data algorithms can
 * usually be designed in a way to treat 2.5d data correclty as well without effecting the runtime
 * complexity.
