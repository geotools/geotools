/**
 * 
 * A Complex is a collection of geometrically disjoint, simple Primitives. If a
 * Primitive (other than a Point) is in a particular Complex, then there exists
 * a set of primitives of lower dimension in the same complex that form the
 * boundary of this primitive.
 * 
 * NOTE A geometric complex can be thought of as a set in two distinct ways.
 * First, it is a finite set of objects (via delegation to its elements member)
 * and, second, it is an infinite set of point values as a subtype of geometric
 * object. The dual use of delegation and subtyping is to disambiguate the two
 * types of set interface. To determine if a Primitive P is an element of a
 * Complex C, call: C.element().contains(P).
 * 
 * The "element" attribute allows Complex to inherit the behavior of Set<Primitive>
 * without confusing the same sort of behavior inherited from TransfiniteSet<DirectPosition2D>
 * inherited through Object. Complexes shall be used in application schemas
 * where the sharing of geometry is important, such as in the use of
 * computational topology. In a complex, primitives may be aggregated
 * many-to-many into composites for use as attributes of features. Examples of
 * this are provided in the schemas in annex D.
