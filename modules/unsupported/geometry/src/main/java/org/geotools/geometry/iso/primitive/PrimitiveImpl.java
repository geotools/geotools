/**
 * 
 * Primitive is the abstract root class of the geometric primitives. Its main
 * purpose is to define the basic "boundary" operation that ties the primitives
 * in each dimension together. A geometric primitive is a geometric object that
 * is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This includes
 * curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and
 * surface patches, respectively. This composition is a strong aggregation:
 * curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the context of a
 * primitive.
 * 
 * NOTE Most geometric primitives are decomposable infinitely many times. Adding
 * a centre point to a line may split that line into two separate lines. A new
 * curve drawn across a surface may divide that surface into two parts, each of
 * which is a surface. This is the reason that the normal definition of
 * primitive as "non-decomposable" is not plausible in a geometry model - the
 * only non-decomposable object in geometry is a point. Any geometric object
 * that is used to describe a feature is a collection of geometric primitives. A
 * collection of geometric primitives may or may not be a geometric complex.
 * Geometric complexes have additional properties such as closure by boundary
 * operations and mutually exclusive component parts.
 * 
 * Primitive and Complex share most semantics, in the meaning of operations,
 * attributes and associations. There is an exception in that a Primitive shall
 * not contain its boundary (except in the trivial case of Point where the
 * boundary is empty), while a Complex shall contain its boundary in all cases.
 * This means that if an instantiated object implements Object operations both
 * as Primitive and as a Complex, the semantics of each set theoretic operation
 * is determined by the its name resolution. Specifically, for a particular
 * object such as CompositeCurve, Primitive::contains (returns FALSE for end
 * points) is different from Complex::contains (returns TRUE for end points).
 * Further, if that object is cast as a Primitive value and as a Complex value,
 * then the two values need not be equal as Objects.
