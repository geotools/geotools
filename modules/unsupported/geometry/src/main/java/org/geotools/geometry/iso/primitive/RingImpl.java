/**
 * A Ring is used to represent a single connected component of a SurfaceBoundary. It consists of a
 * number of references to OrientableCurves connected in a cycle (an object whose boundary is
 * empty). A Ring is structurally similar to a CompositeCurve in that the endPoint of each
 * OrientableCurve in the sequence is the startPoint of the next OrientableCurve in the Sequence.
 * Since the sequence is circular, there is no exception to this rule. Each ring, like all
 * boundaries is a cycle and each ring is simple.
 *
 * <p>Ring: {isSimple() = TRUE}
 *
 * <p>Even though each Ring is simple, the boundary need not be simple. The easiest case of this is
 * where one of the interior rings of a surface is tangent to its exterior ring. Implementations may
 * enforce stronger restrictions on the interaction of boundary elements.
