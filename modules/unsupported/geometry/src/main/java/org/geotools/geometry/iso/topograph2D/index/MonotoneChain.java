/**
 * MonotoneChains are a way of partitioning the segments of an edge to allow for
 * fast searching of intersections. They have the following properties:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the segments within a monotone chain will never intersect each other
 * <li>the envelope of any contiguous subset of the segments in a monotone
 * chain is simply the envelope of the endpoints of the subset.
 * </ol>
 * Property 1 means that there is no need to test pairs of segments from within
 * the same monotone chain for intersection. Property 2 allows binary search to
 * be used to find the intersection points of two monotone chains. For many
 * types of real-world data, these properties eliminate a large number of
 * segment comparisons, producing substantial speed gains.
