     *
     * <font size=2> <strong>NOTE:</strong> The upNormal along a boundary of a solid always points
     * away from the solid. This is a slight semantics problem in dealing with voids within solids,
     * where the upNormal (for sake of mathematical consistency) points into the center of the
     * voided region, which linguistically can be considered the interior of the void. What the
     * confusion is here is that the basic linguistic metaphors used in most languages for "interior
     * of solid" and for "interior of container" use "inward" in inconsistent manners from a
     * topological point of view. The void "in" rock is not inside the rock in the same manner as
     * the solid material that makes up the substance of the rock. Nor is the coffee "in" the cup
     * the same "in" as the ceramic glass "in" the cup. The use of these culturally derived
     * metaphors may not be consistent across all languages, some of which may use different
     * prepositions for these two different concepts. This specification uses the linguistically
     * neutral concept of "interior" derived from mathematics (topology). </font>
