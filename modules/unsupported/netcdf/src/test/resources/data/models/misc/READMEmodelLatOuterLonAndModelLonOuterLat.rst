for test purposes, files modelLatOuterLon and modelLonOuterLat are correlated.
each file has no two temp variable values the same within that file.
both files have the same temp variable values for each combination of dim variable values,
regardless of whether lat is outer of lon or lon is outer of lat.
thousands position is time, hundreds is lat, tens is lon, ones is depth.
values are one-based, not zero based so leading zero does not get truncated.
