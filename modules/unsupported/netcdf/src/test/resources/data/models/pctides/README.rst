The NetCDF data file in the pctides directory, pctides-Ches_basin.nc, was provided by the Naval Oceanographic Office and they have approved its release.

You can confirm this in each data file by opening it and you will see two global attributes:
	:classification_level = "unclassified" ;
    :distribution_statement = "Approved for public release.  Distribution unlimited." ;
