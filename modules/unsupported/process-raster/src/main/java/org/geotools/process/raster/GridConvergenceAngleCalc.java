/**
 * Used to calculate an estimate for the Grid Convergence Angle at a point within a 2D Coordinate Reference System. The Grid Convergence Angle at any
 * point on a projected 2D map is the difference between "up" or "grid north" on the map at that point and True North. Since the map is projected, the
 * Grid Convergence Angle can change at each point on the map; True North can be in a different Cartesian direction on the flat map for every point.
 * One example impact of this is that vectors cannot be accurately drawn on the screen by simply rotating them a certain amount in "screen degrees."
 * This class, then, is used to estimate the Grid Convergence Angle at those points. Though the underlying meaning is the same, different mapping
 * conventions define the angle's direction (+/-) and beginning point / ending point differently. Therefore, for the purposes of this code, the Grid
 * Convergence Angle is defined as the angle (C) FROM true north TO grid north with 0 deg up and angles increasing positively clockwise. So, for the
 * example below, C would be approximately -33 deg, since the angle FROM true north TO grid north is Counter-Clockwise.

 * Some literature (don't have a link) says that the Grid Covergence Angle is really the angle between a line extending toward grid north and one
 * extending toward true north THAT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED into the map projection, but suggests the difference between this angle and the way the angle
 * is being estimated here is small. May want some verification of that. <br>
