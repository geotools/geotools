How to configure test cases:

- Install Solr server as described in https://lucene.apache.org/solr/4_10_0/tutorial.html (version 4.10 is the minimum one able to run bbox related tests)

- After WAR deployment is done downlaod JTS (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/) and copy all JTS <lib> folder JARs into WEB-INF/lib of Solr web application (this enable WKT for Solr 4 Spatial as descripted in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Spatial+Search)

- Create new CORE named TestGeotoolsCore coping the directory on /test/resources/TestGeotoolsCore into SOLR_HOME as the same level of collection1

- Solr server autodiscovery new CORE as described in https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solr.xml%204.4%20and%20beyond and https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Core%20Discovery%20%284.4%20and%20beyond%29

- Copy solr.properties file to $home/.geotools/ (replace SOLR server URL, please check if NO "#" character is present in URL used)

- The test data set wifiAccessPoint.xml will be loaded by each test case into SOLR server automatically at test startup.

- Run tests
